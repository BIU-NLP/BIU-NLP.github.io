When composing natural language instructions, humans naturally evoke abstraction to convey complex procedures in an efficient and concise way. Yet, interpreting and grounding abstraction expressed in NL has not yet been systematically studied in NLP, with no accepted benchmarks specifically eliciting abstraction in NL. In this work, we set the foundation for a systematic study of processing and grounding abstraction in NLP. First, we deliver a novel abstraction elicitation method and present <span class=\"gs_fscp\">Hexagons</span>, a 2D instruction-following game.

This challenge spans all phases of the NLP model\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life cycle: from collecting and annotating relevant data, through devising computational methods for modeling such phenomena, to evaluating and designing proper evaluation metrics.

Addressing these tasks often benefits from identifying a set of evidence spans (eg, sentences), which provide supporting evidence for answering the question. In this work, we propose a novel method for equipping long-context QA models with an additional sequence-level objective for better identification of the supporting evidence. We achieve this via an additional contrastive supervision signal in finetuning, where the model is encouraged to explicitly discriminate supporting evidence sentences from negative ones by maximizing question-evidence similarity. The proposed additional loss exhibits consistent improvements on three different strong long-context transformer models, across two challenging question answering benchmarks\\xe2\\x80\\x93HotpotQA and QAsper."

Particularly, clusters were leveraged to indicate information saliency as well as to avoid redundancy. Such prior methods focused on clustering sentences, even though closely related sentences usually contain also non-aligned parts. In this work, we revisit the clustering approach, grouping together sub-sentential propositions, aiming at more precise information alignment. Specifically, our method detects salient propositions, clusters them into paraphrastic clusters, and generates a representative sentence for each cluster via text fusion. Our summarization method improves over the previous state-of-the-art MDS method in the DUC 2004 and TAC 2011 datasets, both in automatic ROUGE scores and human preference."

While one would like to employ state of the art neural models to improve the quality of interactive summarization, many such technologies cannot ingest the full document set or cannot operate at sufficient speed for interactivity. To that end, we propose two novel deep reinforcement learning models for the task that address, respectively, the subtask of summarizing salient information that adheres to user queries, and the subtask of listing suggested queries to assist users throughout their exploration. In particular, our models allow encoding the interactive session state and history to refrain from redundancy. Together, these models compose a state of the art solution that addresses all of the task requirements. We compare our solution to a recent interactive summarization system, and show through an experimental study involving real users that our models are able to improve informativeness while preserving positive user experience."

    "abstract": "Modern neural models trained on textual data rely on pre-trained representations that emerge without direct supervision. As these representations are increasingly being used in real-world applications, the inability to control their content becomes an increasingly important problem. In this work, we formulate the problem of identifying a linear subspace that corresponds to a given concept, and removing it from the representation. We formulate this problem as a constrained, linear minimax game, and show that existing solutions are generally not optimal for this task. We derive a closed-form solution for certain objectives, and propose a convex relaxation that works well for others. When evaluated in the context of binary gender removal, the method recovers a low-dimensional subspace whose removal mitigates bias by intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation. Surprisingly, we show that the method\\xe2\\x80\\x94despite being linear\\xe2\\x80\\x94is highly expressive, effectively mitigating bias in the output layers of deep, nonlinear classifiers while maintaining tractability and interpretability."

Recent methods have obtained promising results by extracting relation labels from either discourse connectives (DCs) or question-answer (QA) pairs that participants provide. The current contribution studies the effect of worker selection and training on the agreement on implicit relation labels between workers and gold labels, for both the DC and the QA method. In Study 1, workers were not specifically selected or trained, and the results show that there is much room for improvement. Study 2 shows that a combination of selection and training does lead to improved results, but the method is cost-and time-intensive. Study 3 shows that a selection-only approach is a viable alternative; it results in annotations of comparable quality compared to annotations from trained participants. The results generalized over both the DC and QA method and therefore indicate that a selection-only approach could also be effective for other crowdsourced discourse annotation tasks."

The task of Aspect and Opinion Term Extraction presents a special challenge for domain transfer: while opinion terms largely transfer across domains, aspects change drastically from one domain to another (eg from restaurants to laptops). In this paper, we investigate and establish empirically a prior conjecture, which suggests that the linguistic relations connecting opinion terms to their aspects transfer well across domains and therefore can be leveraged for cross-domain aspect term extraction. We present several analyses supporting this conjecture, via experiments with four linguistic dependency formalisms to represent relation patterns. Subsequently, we present an aspect term extraction method that drives models to consider opinion\\xe2\\x80\\x93aspect relations via explicit multitask objectives. This method provides significant performance gains, even on top of a prior state-of-the-art linguistically-informed model, which are shown in analysis to stem from the relational pivoting signal."

While advances reported for English using PLMs are unprecedented, reported advances using PLMs for Hebrew are few and far between. The problem is twofold. First, so far, Hebrew resources for training large language models are not of the same magnitude as their English counterparts. Second, most benchmarks available to evaluate progress in Hebrew NLP require morphological boundaries which are not available in the output of standard PLMs. In this work we remedy both aspects. We present AlephBERT, a large PLM for Modern Hebrew, trained on larger vocabulary and a larger dataset than any Hebrew PLM before. Moreover, we introduce a novel neural architecture that recovers the morphological segments encoded in contextualized embedding vectors. Based on this new morphological component we offer an evaluation suite consisting of multiple tasks and benchmarks that cover sentence-level, word-level and sub-word level analyses. On all tasks, AlephBERT obtains state-of-the-art results beyond contemporary Hebrew baselines. We make our AlephBERT model, the morphological extraction model, and the Hebrew evaluation suite publicly available, for evaluating future Hebrew PLMs."

    "abstract": "Recently, the community has achieved substantial progress on many commonsense reasoning benchmarks. However, it is still unclear what was learned from the training process: the knowledge, how to do inference, or both? We argue that due to the large scale of commonsense knowledge, it is infeasible to annotate a large enough training set for each task to cover all commonsense for learning. Thus we should separate the commonsense knowledge acquisition and inference over commonsense knowledge as two separate tasks. In this work, we focus on investigating models\\' commonsense inference capabilities from two perspectives:(1) Whether models can know if the knowledge they have is enough to solve the task;(2) Whether models can learn commonsense inference capabilities, that generalize across commonsense tasks. We first align commonsense tasks with relevant knowledge from commonsense knowledge bases and ask humans to annotate whether the knowledge is enough or not. Then, we convert different commonsense tasks into a unified question answering format to evaluate models\\' generalization capabilities. We name the benchmark as Commonsense Inference with knowledge-in-the-loop Question Answering (CIKQA)."

Accordingly, a growing body of research is investigating the impact of sex and gender bias in the models and the data on which such models are trained. As NLP systems become more pervasive in our societies, the vulnerability to sex and gender bias may cause the perpetuation of prejudice and discriminatory decisions. To address this challenge, a widespread awareness of bias needs to be created in the NLP community and more robust learning algorithms and fair solutions are required for the development and evaluation of NLP methods. In this chapter, we survey the state-of-the-art NLP models and some popular applications to biomedicine and health, with special emphasis on chatbots for mental health.

It contains disfluencies and ill-formed utterances that the brain needs to contend with in order to extract meaning out of speech. Here, we studied how the neural speech-tracking response is affected by three specific factors that are prevalent in spontaneous colloquial speech: (1) the presence of non-lexical fillers, (2) the need to detect syntactic boundaries in disfluent speech and (3) the effort involved in processing syntactically complex phrases. Neural activity (EEG) was recorded from individuals as they listened to an unscripted, spontaneous narrative, which was analyzed in a time-resolved fashion to identify fillers, detect syntactic boundaries and assess the syntactic complexity of different phrases. When considering these factors in the speech-tracking analysis, we found that it was affected by all of them. The most consistent effect, observed for all three factors, was modulation of a centro-frontal negative response that peaked around 350 ms, highly resembling the well-known N400 ERP response linked to various aspects of lexical access and semantic processing. This response was observed for lexical words but not for fillers, was larger for opening vs. closing words of a clause and was enhanced in response to high-complexity phrases. These findings broaden ongoing efforts to understand neural processing of speech under increasingly realistic conditions. They highlight the importance of considering the imperfect nature of real-life spoken language, linking past research on linguistically well-formed and meticulously controlled speech to the type of speech that the brain actually deals\u00a0\\xe2\\x80\\xa6"

    "abstract": "Morphological tasks use large multi-lingual datasets that organize words into inflection tables, which then serve as training and evaluation data for various tasks. However, a closer inspection of these data reveals profound cross-linguistic inconsistencies, that arise from the lack of a clear linguistic and operational definition of what is a word, and that severely impair the universality of the derived tasks. To overcome this deficiency, we propose to view morphology as a clauselevel phenomenon, rather than word-level. It is anchored in a fixed yet inclusive set of features, that encapsulates all functions realized in a saturated clause. We deliver MIGHTYMORPH, a novel dataset for clause-level morphology covering 4 typologically-different languages: English, German, Turkish and Hebrew. We use this dataset to derive 3 clause-level morphological tasks: inflection, reinflection and analysis. Our experiments show that the clause-level tasks are substantially harder than the respective word-level tasks, while having comparable complexity across languages. Furthermore, redefining morphology to the clause-level provides a neat interface with contextualized language models (LMs) and allows assessing the morphological knowledge encoded in these models and their usability for morphological tasks. Taken together, this work opens up new horizons in the study of computational morphology, leaving ample space for studying neural morphology cross-linguistically."

At inference time, McPhraSy represents each phrase by considering multiple contexts in which it appears and computes the similarity of two phrases by aggregating the pairwise similarities between the contexts of the phrases. Incorporating context during inference enables McPhraSy to outperform current state-of-theart models on two phrase similarity datasets by up to 13.3%.

    "abstract": "99% accuracy), neither approach succeeded in the compositional generalization setting, indicating the limitations of the original training data. We explored ways to augment the original data, and found that though diversifying training data was far more useful than simply increasing dataset size, it was still insufficient for driving robust compositional generalization (with <70% accuracy for complex compositions). Our results underscore the importance of highly controllable task generators for creating robust NLU systems through a virtuous cycle of model and data development."

    "abstract": "Morphological tasks have gained decent popularity within the NLP community in the recent years, with large multi-lingual datasets providing morphological analysis of words, either in or out of context. However, the lack of a clear linguistic definition for words destines the annotative work to be incomplete and mired in inconsistencies, especially cross-linguistically. In this work we expand morphological inflection of words to inflection of sentences to provide true universality disconnected from orthographic traditions of white-space usage. To allow annotation for sentence-inflection we define a morphological annotation scheme by a fixed set of inflectional features. We present a small cross-linguistic dataset including semi-manually generated simple sentences in 4 typologically diverse languages annotated according to our suggested scheme, and show that the task of reinflection gets substantially more difficult but that the change of scope from words to well-defined sentences allows interface with contextualized language models."

Current methods confronting consolidation struggle to fuse overlapping information. In order to explicitly represent content overlap, we propose to align predicate-argument relations across texts, providing a potential scaffold for information consolidation. We go beyond clustering coreferring mentions, and instead model overlap with respect to redundancy at a propositional level, rather than merely detecting shared referents. Our setting exploits QA-SRL, utilizing question-answer pairs to capture predicate-argument relations, facilitating laymen annotation of cross-text alignments. We employ crowd-workers for constructing a dataset of QA-based alignments, and present a baseline QA alignment model trained over our dataset. Analyses show that our new task is semantically challenging\u00a0\\xe2\\x80\\xa6"

Our approach facilitates learning generic inference patterns requiring relational knowledge (eg inferences related to hypernymy) during training, while injecting on-demand the relevant relational facts (eg pangolin is an animal) at test time. We apply InferBERT to the NLI task over a diverse set of inference types (hypernymy, location, color, and country of origin), for which we collected challenge datasets. In this setting, InferBert succeeds to learn general inference patterns, from a relatively small number of training instances, while not hurting performance on the original NLI data and substantially outperforming prior knowledge enhancement models on the challenge data. It further applies its inferences successfully at test time to previously unobserved entities. InferBert is computationally more efficient than most prior methods, in terms of number of parameters, memory consumption and training time."

This challenge spans all phases of the NLP model\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life cycle: from collecting and annotating relevant data, through devising computational methods for modelling such phenomena, to evaluating and designing proper evaluation metrics."

    "abstract": "What is the computational model behind a Transformer? Where recurrent neural networks have direct parallels in finite state machines, allowing clear discussion and thought around architecture variants or trained models, Transformers have no such familiar parallel. In this paper we aim to change that, proposing a computational model for the transformer-encoder in the form of a programming language. We map the basic components of a transformer-encoder\\xe2\\x80\\x94attention and feed-forward computation\\xe2\\x80\\x94into simple primitives, around which we form a programming language: the Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language (RASP). We show how RASP can be used to program solutions to tasks that could conceivably be learned by a Transformer, and how a Transformer can be trained to mimic a RASP solution. In particular, we provide RASP programs for histograms, sorting, and Dyck-languages. We further use our model to relate their difficulty in terms of the number of required layers and attention heads: analyzing a RASP program implies a maximum number of heads and layers necessary to encode a task in a transformer. Finally, we see how insights gained from our abstraction might be used to explain phenomena seen in recent works."

Different ideas for interactive summarization have been proposed in previous work but these solutions are highly divergent and incomparable. In this paper, we develop an end-to-end evaluation framework for interactive summarization, focusing on expansion-based interaction, which considers the accumulating information along a user session. Our framework includes a procedure of collecting real user sessions, as well as evaluation measures relying on summarization standards, but adapted to reflect interaction. All of our solutions and resources are available publicly as a benchmark, allowing comparison of future developments in interactive summarization, and spurring progress in its methodological evaluation. We demonstrate the use of our framework by evaluating and comparing baseline implementations that we developed for this purpose, which will serve as part of our benchmark. Our extensive experimentation and analysis motivate the proposed evaluation framework design and support its viability."

These lexicons are useful for various psychology applications such as detecting emotional state, well being, relationship quality in conversation, identifying topics (eg, family, work) and many more. We discuss the challenges in creating and validating lexicons in a new language, and highlight our methodological considerations in the data-driven lexicon construction process. Most of the lexicons are publicly available, which will facilitate further research on Hebrew clinical psychology text analysis. The lexicons were developed through data driven means, and verified by domain experts, clinical psychologists and psychology students, in a process of reconciliation with three judges. Development and verification relied on a dataset of a total of 872 psychotherapy session transcripts. We describe the construction process of each collection, the final resource and initial results of research studies employing this resource."

Focusing on the realistic scenario of FSL, in which a test instance might not belong to any of the target categories (none-of-the-above, [NOTA]), we first revisit the recent popular dataset structure for FSL, pointing out its unrealistic data distribution. To remedy this, we propose a novel methodology for deriving more realistic few-shot test data from available datasets for supervised RC, and apply it to the TACRED dataset. This yields a new challenging benchmark for FSL-RC, on which state of the art models show poor performance. Next, we analyze classification schemes within the popular embedding-based nearest-neighbor approach for FSL, with respect to constraints they impose on the embedding space. Triggered by this analysis, we propose a novel classification scheme in which the NOTA category is represented as learned vectors, shown\u00a0\\xe2\\x80\\xa6"

Our cross-document language model (CD-LM) improves masked language modeling for these tasks with two key ideas. First, we pretrain with multiple related documents in a single input, via cross-document masking, which encourages the model to learn cross-document and long-range relationships. Second, extending the recent Longformer model, we pretrain with long contexts of several thousand tokens and introduce a new attention pattern that uses sequence-level global attention to predict masked tokens, while retaining the familiar local attention elsewhere. We show that our CD-LM sets new state-of-the-art results for several multi-text tasks, including cross-document event and entity coreference resolution, paper citation recommendation, and documents plagiarism detection, while using a significantly reduced number of training parameters relative to prior works."

In this paper, we evaluate representations based on skeleton poses, as these are explainable, person-independent, privacy-preserving, low-dimensional representations. Basically, skeletal representations generalize over an individual\\'s appearance and background, allowing us to focus on the recognition of motion. But how much information is lost by the skeletal representation? We perform two independent studies using two state-of-the-art pose estimation systems. We analyze the applicability of the pose estimation systems to sign language recognition by evaluating the failure cases of the recognition models. Importantly, this allows us to characterize the current limitations of skeletal pose estimation approaches in sign language recognition."

However, efforts to understand whether LM representations are useful for symbolic reasoning tasks have been limited and scattered. In this work, we propose eight reasoning tasks, which conceptually require operations such as comparison, conjunction, and composition. A fundamental challenge is to understand whether the performance of a LM on a task should be attributed to the pre-trained representations or to the process of fine-tuning on the task data. To address this, we propose an evaluation protocol that includes both zero-shot evaluation (no fine-tuning), as well as comparing the learning curve of a fine-tuned LM to the learning curve of multiple controls, which paints a rich picture of the LM capabilities. Our main findings are that: (a) different LMs exhibit qualitatively\u00a0\\xe2\\x80\\xa6"

    "abstract": "Morphologically Rich Languages (MRLs) such as Arabic, Hebrew and Turkish often require Morphological Disambiguation (MD), ie, the prediction of morphological decomposition of tokens into morphemes, early in the pipeline. Neural MD may be addressed as a simple pipeline, where segmentation is followed by sequence tagging, or as an end-to-end model, predicting morphemes from raw tokens. Both approaches are sub-optimal; the former is heavily prone to error propagation, and the latter does not enjoy explicit access to the basic processing units called morphemes. This paper offers MD architecture that combines the symbolic knowledge of morphemes with the learning capacity of neural end-to-end modeling. We propose a new, general and easy-to-implement Pointer Network model where the input is a morphological lattice and the output is a sequence of indices pointing at a single disambiguated path of morphemes. We demonstrate the efficacy of the model on segmentation and tagging, for Hebrew and Turkish texts, based on their respective Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks. Our experiments show that with complete lattices, our model outperforms all shared-task results on segmenting and tagging these languages. On the SPMRL treebank, our model outperforms all previously reported results for Hebrew MD in realistic scenarios."

Unfortunately, when a dataset has systematic gaps (eg, annotation artifacts), these evaluations are misleading: a model can learn simple decision rules that perform well on the test set but do not capture the abilities a dataset is intended to test. We propose a more rigorous annotation paradigm for NLP that helps to close systematic gaps in the test data. In particular, after a dataset is constructed, we recommend that the dataset authors manually perturb the test instances in small but meaningful ways that (typically) change the gold label, creating contrast sets. Contrast sets provide a local view of a model\u2019s decision boundary, which can be used to more accurately evaluate a model\u2019s true linguistic capabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of contrast sets by creating them for 10 diverse NLP datasets (eg, DROP reading comprehension, UD parsing, and IMDb sentiment analysis). Although our contrast sets are not explicitly adversarial, model performance is significantly lower on them than on the original test sets\u2014up to 25% in some cases. We release our contrast sets as new evaluation benchmarks and encourage future dataset construction efforts to follow similar annotation processes."

Our analyses suggest that (1) idiomatic choices reflect gender-specific lexical and semantic preferences in general language,(2) men's and women's idiomatic usages express higher emotion than their literal language, with detectable, albeit more subtle, differences between male and female authors along the dimension of dominance compared to similar distinctions in their literal utterances, and (3) contextual analysis of idiomatic expressions reveals considerable differences, reflecting subtle divergences in usage environments, shaped by cross-gender communication styles and semantic biases."

We study the word-level translation information embedded in mBERT and present two simple methods that expose remarkable translation capabilities with no fine-tuning. The results suggest that most of this information is encoded in a non-linear way, while some of it can also be recovered with purely linear tools. As part of our analysis, we test the hypothesis that mBERT learns representations which contain both a language-encoding component and an abstract, cross-lingual component, and explicitly identify an empirical language-identity subspace within mBERT representations."

Here, we suggest focusing on the textual description and distilling from the description the most relevant information to effectively match visual features to the parts of the text that discuss them. Specifically,(1) we propose to leverage the similarity between species, reflected in the similarity between text descriptions of the species.(2) we derive visual summaries of the texts, ie, extractive summaries that focus on the visual features that tend to be reflected in images. We propose a simple attention-based model augmented with the similarity and visual summaries components. Our empirical results consistently and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art on the largest benchmarks for text-based zero-shot learning, illustrating the critical importance of texts for zero-shot image-recognition."

This paper proposes a novel representation of discourse relations as QA pairs, which in turn allows us to crowd-source wide-coverage data annotated with discourse relations, via an intuitively appealing interface for composing such questions and answers. Based on our proposed representation, we collect a novel and wide-coverage QADiscourse dataset, and present baseline algorithms for predicting QADiscourse relations."

Particularly difficult are cases of unbalanced ambiguity, where one of the possible analyses is far more frequent than the others.

In this paper we address the issue of unbalanced morphological ambiguities in Hebrew. We offer a challenge set for Hebrew homographs--the first of its kind--containing substantial attestation of each analysis of 21 Hebrew homographs. We show that the current SOTA of Hebrew disambiguation performs poorly on cases of unbalanced ambiguity. Leveraging our new dataset, we achieve a new state-of-the-art for all 21 words, improving the overall average F1 score from 0.67 to 0.95. Our resulting annotated datasets are made publicly available for further research."

Aiming to set baseline results for future research that would follow our evaluation methodology, we build the first end-to-end model for this task. Our model adapts and extends recent neural models for within-document coreference resolution to address the CD coreference setting, which outperforms state-of-the-art results by a significant margin."

While alignment of spans between reference summaries and source documents has been leveraged for training component tasks, the underlying alignment step was never independently addressed or evaluated. We advocate developing high quality source-reference alignment algorithms, that can be applied to recent large-scale datasets to obtain useful\" silver\", ie approximate, training data. As a first step, we present an annotation methodology by which we create gold standard development and test sets for summary-source alignment, and suggest its utility for tuning and evaluating effective alignment algorithms, as well as for properly evaluating MDS subtasks. Second, we introduce a new large-scale alignment dataset for training, with which an automatic alignment model was trained. This aligner achieves higher coherency with the reference summary than previous aligners used for summarization, and gets significantly higher ROUGE results when replacing a simpler aligner in a competitive summarization model. Finally, we release three additional datasets (for salience, clustering and generation), naturally derived from our alignment datasets. Furthermore, these datasets can be derived from any summarization dataset automatically after extracting alignments with our trained aligner. Hence, they can be utilized for training summarization sub-tasks."

Morphologically-Rich Languages (MRLs) pose a challenge to this basic formulation, as the boundaries of Named Entities do not coincide with token boundaries, rather, they respect morphological boundaries. To address NER in MRLs we then need to answer two fundamental modeling questions:(i) What should be the basic units to be identified and labeled, are they token-based or morpheme-based? and (ii) How can morphological units be encoded and accurately obtained in realistic (non-gold) scenarios? We empirically investigate these questions on a novel parallel NER benchmark we deliver, with parallel token-level and morpheme-level NER annotations for Modern Hebrew, a morphologically complex language. Our results show that explicitly modeling morphological boundaries consistently leads to improved NER performance, and that a novel hybrid architecture that we propose, in which NER precedes and prunes the morphological decomposition (MD) space, greatly outperforms the standard pipeline approach, on both Hebrew NER and Hebrew MD in realistic scenarios."

In this paper, we present an improved crowdsourcing protocol for complex semantic annotation, involving worker selection and training, and a data consolidation phase. Applying this protocol to QA-SRL yielded high-quality annotation with drastically higher coverage, producing a new gold evaluation dataset. We believe that our annotation protocol and gold standard will facilitate future replicable research of natural semantic annotations."

    "abstract": "The problem of comparing two bodies of text and searching for words that differ in their usage between them arises often in digital humanities and computational social science. This is commonly approached by training word embeddings on each corpus, aligning the vector spaces, and looking for words whose cosine distance in the aligned space is large. However, these methods often require extensive filtering of the vocabulary to perform well, and-as we show in this work-result in unstable, and hence less reliable, results. We propose an alternative approach that does not use vector space alignment, and instead considers the neighbors of each word. The method is simple, interpretable and stable. We demonstrate its effectiveness in 9 different setups, considering different corpus splitting criteria (age, gender and profession of tweet authors, time of tweet) and different languages (English, French and Hebrew)."

    "abstract": "This work investigates the most basic units that underlie contextualized word embeddings, such as BERT\u2014the so-called word pieces. In Morphologically-Rich Languages (MRLs) which exhibit morphological fusion and non-concatenative morphology, the different units of meaning within a word may be fused, intertwined, and cannot be separated linearly. Therefore, when using word-pieces in MRLs, we must consider that:(1) a linear segmentation into sub-word units might not capture the full morphological complexity of words; and (2) representations that leave morphological knowledge on sub-word units inaccessible might negatively affect performance. Here we empirically examine the capacity of word-pieces to capture morphology by investigating the task of multi-tagging in Modern Hebrew, as a proxy to evaluate the underlying segmentation. Our results show that, while models trained to predict multi-tags for complete words outperform models tuned to predict the distinct tags of WPs, we can improve the WPs tag prediction by purposefully constraining the word-pieces to reflect their internal functions. We suggest that linguistically-informed word-pieces schemes, that make the morphological structure explicit, might boost performance for MRLs."

We reformulate faithfulness as an accurate attribution of causality to the model, and introduce the concept of aligned faithfulness: faithful causal chains that are aligned with their expected social behavior. The two steps of causal attribution and social attribution together complete the process of explaining behavior. With this formalization, we characterize various failures of misaligned faithful highlight interpretations, and propose an alternative causal chain to remedy the issues.

Equipped with this new analysis tool, we can ask questions that were not possible before, eg is part-of-speech information important for word prediction?

However, their utility can be improved. These syntactic dependencies are designed to accurately reflect syntactic relations, and they do not make semantic relations explicit. Therefore, these representations lack many explicit connections between content words, that would be useful for downstream applications. Proposals like English Enhanced UD improve the situation by extending universal dependency trees with additional explicit arcs. However, they are not available to Python users, and are also limited in coverage. We introduce a broad-coverage, data-driven and linguistically sound set of transformations, that makes event-structure and many lexical relations explicit. We present pyBART, an easy-to-use open-source Python library for converting English UD trees either to Enhanced UD graphs or to our representation. The library can work as a standalone package or be integrated within a spaCy NLP pipeline. When evaluated in a pattern-based relation extraction scenario, our representation results in higher extraction scores than Enhanced UD, while requiring fewer patterns."

The task is of great practical utility, and also of theoretical utility as it requires generalization from few examples. Previous approaches to the TSE task can be characterized as either distributional or pattern-based. We harness the power of neural masked language models (MLM) and propose a novel TSE algorithm, which combines the pattern-based and distributional approaches. Due to the small size of the seed set, fine-tuning methods are not effective, calling for more creative use of the MLM. The gist of the idea is to use the MLM to first mine for informative patterns with respect to the seed set, and then to obtain more members of the seed class by generalizing these patterns. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art TSE algorithms. Implementation is available at: this https URL guykush/TermSetExpansion-MPB/"

The association between linguistic features and levels of distress was examined using multilevel models.

Then, we used the same re-ranking features as additional inputs to a state-of-the-art event coreference resolution model, which yielded modest but consistent improvements to the model's performance. The results suggest a promising direction to leverage data and models for each of the tasks to the benefit of the other."

The hierarchy is based on two formal properties: space complexity, which measures the RNN's memory, and rational recurrence, defined as whether the recurrent update can be described by a weighted finite-state machine. We place several RNN variants within this hierarchy. For example, we prove the LSTM is not rational, which formally separates it from the related QRNN (Bradbury et al., 2016). We also show how these models' expressive capacity is expanded by stacking multiple layers or composing them with different pooling functions. Our results build on the theory of\" saturated\" RNNs (Merrill, 2019). While formally extending these findings to unsaturated RNNs is left to future work, we hypothesize that the practical learnable capacity of unsaturated RNNs obeys a similar hierarchy. Experimental findings from training unsaturated networks on formal languages support this conjecture."

By doing so, the classifiers become oblivious to that target property, making it hard to linearly separate the data according to it. While applicable for general scenarios, we evaluate our method on bias and fairness use-cases, and show that our method is able to mitigate bias in word embeddings, as well as to increase fairness in a setting of multi-class classification."

Unfortunately, when a dataset has systematic gaps (eg, annotation artifacts), these evaluations are misleading: a model can learn simple decision rules that perform well on the test set but do not capture a dataset's intended capabilities. We propose a new annotation paradigm for NLP that helps to close systematic gaps in the test data. In particular, after a dataset is constructed, we recommend that the dataset authors manually perturb the test instances in small but meaningful ways that (typically) change the gold label, creating contrast sets. Contrast sets provide a local view of a model's decision boundary, which can be used to more accurately evaluate a model's true linguistic capabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of contrast sets by creating them for 10 diverse NLP datasets (eg, DROP reading comprehension, UD parsing, IMDb sentiment analysis). Although our contrast sets are not explicitly adversarial, model performance is significantly lower on them than on the original test sets---up to 25\\\\% in some cases. We release our contrast sets as new evaluation benchmarks and encourage future dataset construction efforts to follow similar annotation processes."

    "abstract": "The notion of\" in-domain data\" in NLP is often over-simplistic and vague, as textual data varies in many nuanced linguistic aspects such as topic, style or level of formality. In addition, domain labels are many times unavailable, making it challenging to build domain-specific systems. We show that massive pre-trained language models implicitly learn sentence representations that cluster by domains without supervision--suggesting a simple data-driven definition of domains in textual data. We harness this property and propose domain data selection methods based on such models, which require only a small set of in-domain monolingual data. We evaluate our data selection methods for neural machine translation across five diverse domains, where they outperform an established approach as measured by both BLEU and by precision and recall of sentence selection with respect to an oracle."

    "abstract": "Large-scale natural language understanding (NLU) systems have made impressive progress: they can be applied flexibly across a variety of tasks, and employ minimal structural assumptions. However, extensive empirical research has shown this to be a double-edged sword, coming at the cost of shallow understanding: inferior generalization, grounding and explainability. Grounded language learning approaches offer the promise of deeper understanding by situating learning in richer, more structured training environments, but are limited in scale to relatively narrow, predefined domains. How might we enjoy the best of both worlds: grounded, general NLU? Following extensive contemporary cognitive science, we propose treating environments as``first-class citizens''in semantic representations, worthy of research and development in their own right. Importantly, models should also be partners in the creation and configuration of environments, rather than just actors within them, as in existing approaches. To do so, we argue that models must begin to understand and program in the language of affordances (which define possible actions in a given situation) both for online, situated discourse comprehension, as well as large-scale, offline common-sense knowledge mining. To this end we propose an environment-oriented ecological semantics, outlining theoretical and practical approaches towards implementation. We further provide actual demonstrations building upon interactive fiction programming languages."

We present the first scalable approach for annotating cross-subtopic event coreference links, a highly valuable but rarely occurring type of cross-document link. The annotation of these links requires combing through hundreds of documents\u2013an endeavor for which conventional token-level annotation schemes with trained expert annotators are too expensive. We instead propose crowdsourcing annotation on sentence level to achieve scalability.

Our dataset further serves to highlight the limitations of the current task definition which requires a single translation be produced, even in the presence of underspecified input."

    "abstract": "Recent success of pre-trained language models (LMs) has spurred widespread interest in the language capabilities that they possess. However, efforts to understand whether LM representations are useful for symbolic reasoning tasks have been limited and scattered. In this work, we propose eight reasoning tasks, which conceptually require operations such as comparison, conjunction, and composition. A fundamental challenge is to understand whether the performance of a LM on a task should be attributed to the pre-trained representations or to the process of fine-tuning on the task data. To address this, we propose an evaluation protocol that includes both zero-shot evaluation (no fine-tuning), as well as comparing the learning curve of a fine-tuned LM to the learning curve of multiple controls, which paints a rich picture of the LM capabilities. Our main findings are that:(a) different LMs exhibit qualitatively different reasoning abilities, eg, RoBERTa succeeds in reasoning tasks where BERT fails completely;(b) LMs do not reason in an abstract manner and are context-dependent, eg, while RoBERTa can compare ages, it can do so only when the ages are in the typical range of human ages;(c) On half of our reasoning tasks all models fail completely. Our findings and infrastructure can help future work on designing new datasets, models and objective functions for pre-training."

Trying to replicate the QA-SRL annotation and evaluation scheme for new texts, we observed that the resulting annotations were lacking in quality and coverage, particularly insufficient for creating gold standards for evaluation. In this paper, we present an improved QA-SRL annotation protocol, involving crowd-worker selection and training, followed by data consolidation. Applying this process, we release a new gold evaluation dataset for QA-SRL, yielding more consistent annotations and greater coverage. We believe that our new annotation protocol and gold standard will facilitate future replicable research of natural semantic annotations."

We revisit their experiments and conduct a series of follow-up experiments showing that, in fact, the diagnostic classifier generalizes poorly to both new in-domain samples and new domains, indicating that it relies on correlations specific to their particular data sample. We further show that a diagnostic classifier trained on the biased baseline neural network also does not generalize to new samples. In other words, the biases detected in Elazar and Goldberg (2018) seem restricted to their particular data sample, and would therefore not bias the decisions of the model on new samples, whether in-domain or out-of-domain. In light of this, we discuss better methodologies for detecting bias in our models."

In such languages, words that relate to the gender-marked nouns are inflected to agree with the noun's gender. We show that this affects the word representations of inanimate nouns, resulting in nouns with the same gender being closer to each other than nouns with different gender. While\" embedding debiasing\" methods fail to remove the effect, we demonstrate that a careful application of methods that neutralize grammatical gender signals from the words' context when training word embeddings is effective in removing it. Fixing the grammatical gender bias yields a positive effect on the quality of the resulting word embeddings, both in monolingual and cross-lingual settings. We note that successfully removing gender signals, while achievable, is not trivial to do and that a language-specific morphological analyzer, together with careful usage of it, are essential for achieving good results."

Information Retrieval (IR) solutions treat the document set as a query, and look for similar documents in the collection. We propose to extend the IR approach by treating the problem as an instance of positive-unlabeled (PU) learning---ie, learning binary classifiers from only positive and unlabeled data, where the positive data corresponds to the query documents, and the unlabeled data is the results returned by the IR engine. Utilizing PU learning for text with big neural networks is a largely unexplored field. We discuss various challenges in applying PU learning to the setting, including an unknown class prior, extremely imbalanced data and large-scale accurate evaluation of models, and we propose solutions and empirically validate them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method using a series of experiments of retrieving PubMed abstracts adhering to fine-grained topics. We demonstrate improvements over the base IR solution and other baselines. Implementation is available at this https URL."

Yet, although a model can improve in such a training process, it might still be vulnerable to other challenge datasets targeting the same phenomenon but drawn from a different distribution, such as having a different syntactic complexity level. In this work, we extend this method to drive conclusions about a model's ability to learn and generalize a target phenomenon rather than to\" learn\" a dataset, by controlling additional aspects in the adversarial datasets. We demonstrate our approach on two inference phenomena-dative alternation and numerical reasoning, elaborating, and in some cases contradicting, the results of Liu et al.. Our methodology enables building better challenge datasets for creating more robust models, and may yield better model understanding and subsequent overarching improvements."

We suggest four extensions to that framework:(1) we introduce a trainable neural planning component that can generate effective plans several orders of magnitude faster than the original planner;(2) we incorporate typing hints that improve the model's ability to deal with unseen relations and entities;(3) we introduce a verification-by-reranking stage that substantially improves the faithfulness of the resulting texts;(4) we incorporate a simple but effective referring expression generation module. These extensions result in a generation process that is faster, more fluent, and more accurate."

Knowledge of the environment may be provided via visual sensors or as a symbolic world representation referred to as a map. Here we introduce the Realistic Urban Navigation (RUN) task, aimed at interpreting navigation instructions based on a real, dense, urban map. Using Amazon Mechanical Turk, we collected a dataset of 2515 instructions aligned with actual routes over three regions of Manhattan. We propose a strong baseline for the task and empirically investigate which aspects of the neural architecture are important for the RUN success. Our results empirically show that entity abstraction, attention over words and worlds, and a constantly updating world-state, significantly contribute to task accuracy."

The system is interpretable and user friendly and does not require labeled training data, hence can be rapidly and cost-effectively used across different domains in applied setups. The system flow includes three stages: First, it generates domain-specific aspect and opinion lexicons based on an unlabeled dataset; second, it enables the user to view and edit those lexicons (weak supervision); and finally, it enables the user to select an unlabeled target dataset from the same domain, classify it, and generate an aspect-based sentiment report. ABSApp has been successfully used in a number of real-life use cases, among them movie review analysis and convention impact analysis."

However, summaries with high ROUGE scores often receive low human judgement. To find a better reward function that can guide RL to generate human-appealing summaries, we learn a reward function from human ratings on 2,500 summaries. Our reward function only takes the document and system summary as input. Hence, once trained, it can be used to train RL-based summarisation systems without using any reference summaries. We show that our learned rewards have significantly higher correlation with human ratings than previous approaches. Human evaluation experiments show that, compared to the state-of-the-art supervised-learning systems and ROUGE-as-rewards RL summarisation systems, the RL systems using our learned rewards during training generate summarieswith higher human ratings. The learned reward function and our source code are available at this https URL."

    "abstract": "This paper treats gender bias latent in word embeddings. Previous mitigation attempts rely on the operationalisation of gender bias as a projection over a linear subspace. An alternative approach is Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA), in which a corpus is duplicated and augmented to remove bias, eg by swapping all inherently-gendered words in the copy. We perform an empirical comparison of these approaches on the English Gigaword and Wikipedia, and find that whilst both successfully reduce direct bias and perform well in tasks which quantify embedding quality, CDA variants outperform projection-based methods at the task of drawing non-biased gender analogies by an average of 19% across both corpora. We propose two improvements to CDA: Counterfactual Data Substitution (CDS), a variant of CDA in which potentially biased text is randomly substituted to avoid duplication, and the Names Intervention, a novel name-pairing technique that vastly increases the number of words being treated. CDA/S with the Names Intervention is the only approach which is able to mitigate indirect gender bias: following debiasing, previously biased words are significantly less clustered according to gender (cluster purity is reduced by 49%), thus improving on the state-of-the-art for bias mitigation."

We then use a model trained for A to label a large corpus, and use this corpus with an XR loss to train a model for task B. To make the XR framework applicable to large-scale deep-learning setups, we propose a stochastic batched approximation procedure. We demonstrate the approach on the task of Aspect-based Sentiment classification, where we effectively use a sentence-level sentiment predictor to train accurate aspect-based predictor. The method improves upon fully supervised neural system trained on aspect-level data, and is also cumulative with LM-based pretraining, as we demonstrate by improving a BERT-based Aspect-based Sentiment model."

This missing information is implicit and is important for sentence understanding. The missing references are easily filled in by humans but pose a challenge for computational models. We formulate the handling of FHs as a two stages process: <b>Identification</b> of the FH construction and <b>resolution</b> of the missing head. We explore the NFH phenomena in large corpora of English text and create (1) a data set and a highly accurate method for NFH identification; (2) a 10k examples (1 M tokens) crowd-sourced data set of NFH resolution; and (3) a neural baseline for the NFH resolution task. We release our code and data set, to foster further research into this challenging problem."

A common crowdsourcing practice is to recruit a small number of high-quality workers, and have them massively generate examples. Having only a few workers generate the majority of examples raises concerns about data diversity, especially when workers freely generate sentences. In this paper, we perform a series of experiments showing these concerns are evident in three recent NLP datasets. We show that model performance improves when training with annotator identifiers as features, and that models are able to recognize the most productive annotators. Moreover, we show that often models do not generalize well to examples from annotators that did not contribute to the training set. Our findings suggest that annotator bias should be monitored during dataset creation, and that test set annotators should be disjoint from training set annotators."

For many morphologically-rich languages (MRLs), similar pipelines show sub-optimal performance that limits their applicability for text analysis in research and the industry. The sub-optimal performance is mainly due to errors in early morphological disambiguation decisions, which cannot be recovered later in the pipeline, yielding incoherent annotations on the whole. In this paper we describe the design and use of the Onlp suite, a joint morpho-syntactic parsing framework for processing Modern Hebrew texts. The joint inference over morphology and syntax substantially limits error propagation, and leads to high accuracy. Onlp provides rich and expressive output which already serves diverse academic and commercial needs. Its accompanying online demo further serves educational activities, introducing Hebrew NLP intricacies to researchers and non-researchers alike."

We address the task of proto-word reconstruction, in which the model is exposed to cognates in contemporary daughter languages, and has to predict the proto word in the ancestor language. We provide a novel dataset for this task, encompassing over 8,000 comparative entries, and show that neural sequence models outperform conventional methods applied to this task so far. Error analysis reveals a variability in the ability of neural model to capture different phonological changes, correlating with the complexity of the changes. Analysis of learned embeddings reveals the models learn phonologically meaningful generalizations, corresponding to well-attested phonological shifts documented by historical linguistics."

We study whether textual entailment predictions can be used to detect such errors and if they can be reduced by reranking alternative predicted summaries.

We represent an event (entity) mention using its lexical span, surrounding context, and relation to entity (event) mentions via predicate-arguments structures. Our model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art event coreference model on ECB+, while providing the first entity coreference results on this corpus. Our analysis confirms that all our representation elements, including the mention span itself, its context, and the relation to other mentions contribute to the model's success."

To alleviate the effect of length during evaluation, we have proposed a new method which normalizes the ROUGE F1 scores of a system by that of a random system with same average output length. A pilot human evaluation has shown that humans prefer short summaries in terms of the verbosity of a summary but overall consider longer summaries to be of higher quality. While human evaluations are more expensive in time and resources, it is clear that normalization, such as the one we proposed for automatic evaluation, will make human evaluations more meaningful."

For training a plan-to-text generator, we present a method for matching reference texts to their corresponding text plans. For inference time, we describe a method for selecting high-quality text plans for new inputs. We implement and evaluate our approach on the WebNLG benchmark. Our results demonstrate that decoupling text planning from neural realization indeed improves the system's reliability and adequacy while maintaining fluent output. We observe improvements both in BLEU scores and in manual evaluations. Another benefit of our approach is the ability to output diverse realizations of the same input, paving the way to explicit control over the generated text structure."

We propose a paradigm that addresses these issues: we create synthetic versions of English, which differ from English in one or more typological parameters, and generate corpora for those languages based on a parsed English corpus. We report a series of experiments in which RNNs were trained to predict agreement features for verbs in each of those synthetic languages. Among other findings,(1) performance was higher in subject-verb-object order (as in English) than in subject-object-verb order (as in Japanese), suggesting that RNNs have a recency bias;(2) predicting agreement with both subject and object (polypersonal agreement) improves over predicting each separately, suggesting that underlying syntactic knowledge transfers across the two tasks; and (3) overt morphological case makes agreement prediction significantly easier, regardless of word order."

This phenomenon is pervasive and consistent across different word embedding models, causing serious concern. Several recent works tackle this problem, and propose methods for significantly reducing this gender bias in word embeddings, demonstrating convincing results. However, we argue that this removal is superficial. While the bias is indeed substantially reduced according to the provided bias definition, the actual effect is mostly hiding the bias, not removing it. The gender bias information is still reflected in the distances between\" gender-neutralized\" words in the debiased embeddings, and can be recovered from them. We present a series of experiments to support this claim, for two debiasing methods. We conclude that existing bias removal techniques are insufficient, and should not be trusted for providing gender-neutral modeling."

We demonstrate that such noise substantially degrades the accuracy of the learned translation when using current methods. We propose a model that accounts for noisy pairs. This is achieved by introducing a generative model with a compatible iterative EM algorithm. The algorithm jointly learns the noise level in the lexicon, finds the set of noisy pairs, and learns the mapping between the spaces.

In this work we empirically confirm this hypothesis for Modern Hebrew, an MRL with complex morphology and severe word-level ambiguity, in a novel transition-based framework. Specifically, we propose a joint morphosyntactic transition-based framework which formally unifies two distinct transition systems, morphological and syntactic, into a single transition-based system with joint training and joint inference. We empirically show that MA&D results obtained in the joint settings outperform MA&D results obtained by the respective standalone components, and\\xa0\u2026"

However, it is exposed to a security threat in which Byzantine participants can interrupt or control the learning process. Previous attack models assume that the rogue participants (a) are omniscient (know the data of all other participants), and (b) introduce large changes to the parameters. Accordingly, most defense mechanisms make a similar assumption and attempt to use statistically robust methods to identify and discard values whose reported gradients are far from the population mean. We observe that if the empirical variance between the gradients of workers is high enough, an attacker could take advantage of this and launch a non-omniscient attack that operates within the population variance. We show that the variance is indeed high enough even for simple datasets such as MNIST, allowing an attack that is not only undetected by existing defenses, but also uses their power against them, causing those defense mechanisms to consistently select the byzantine workers while discarding legitimate ones. We demonstrate our attack method works not only for preventing convergence but also for repurposing of the model behavior (``backdooring''). We show that less than 25\\\\% of colluding workers are sufficient to degrade the accuracy of models trained on MNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 by 50\\\\%, as well as to introduce backdoors without hurting the accuracy for MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, but with a degradation for CIFAR100."

We show how enriching the training data to better capture word order constraints almost doubles the performance of the system. We further demonstrate that encoding both local and global prediction contexts yields another considerable performance boost. With the proposed modifications, the system which ranked low in the latest shared task on multilingual surface realization now achieves best results in five out of ten languages, while being on par with the state-of-the-art approaches in others."

When applied to RNNs, our algorithm returns models with better or equal word error rate (WER) and normalised distributed cumulative gain (NDCG) than achieved by n-gram or weighted finite automata (WFA) approximations of the same networks.

In this work we set out to manually validate the UDv2 version and, accordingly, we apply scheme changes to bring the UD HTB into the same theoretical ground as the rest of UD. Our experimental results show that improving the linguistic coherence and internal consistency of the UD HTB has indeed led to improved syntactic parsing performance. At the same time, there is more to be done at the points of intersection with other linguistic processing layers, in particular, at the interface of UD with external morphological and lexical resources."

We tackle these three issues: we propose an ASR-motivated evaluation setup which is decoupled from an ASR system and the choice of vocabulary, and provide an evaluation dataset for English-Spanish code-switching. This setup lends itself to a discriminative training approach, which we demonstrate to work better than generative language modeling. Finally, we explore a variety of training protocols and verify the effectiveness of training with large amounts of monolingual data followed by fine-tuning with small amounts of code-switched data, for both the generative and discriminative cases."

Our results on Hebrew underscore the importance of CoNLL-UL, a UD-compatible standard for accessing external lexical resources, for enhancing end-to-end UD parsing, in particular for morphologically rich and low-resource languages.

We examine common hypotheses to this problem: that filters, accompanied by global max-pooling, serve as ngram detectors. We show that filters may capture several different semantic classes of ngrams by using different activation patterns, and that global max-pooling induces behavior which separates important ngrams from the rest. Finally, we show practical use cases derived from our findings in the form of model interpretability (explaining a trained model by deriving a concrete identity for each filter, bridging the gap between visualization tools in vision tasks and NLP) and prediction interpretability (explaining predictions).

We show that demographic information of authors is encoded in--and can be recovered from--the intermediate representations learned by text-based neural classifiers. The implication is that decisions of classifiers trained on textual data are not agnostic to--and likely condition on--demographic attributes. When attempting to remove such demographic information using adversarial training, we find that while the adversarial component achieves chance-level development-set accuracy during training, a post-hoc classifier, trained on the encoded sentences from the first part, still manages to reach substantially higher classification accuracies on the same data. This behavior is consistent across several tasks, demographic properties and datasets. We explore several techniques to improve the effectiveness of the adversarial component. Our main conclusion is a cautionary one: do not rely on the adversarial training to achieve invariant representation to sensitive features."

Privacy risks of such systems have previously been studied mostly in the context of recovery of personal information in the form of usage records from the training data. However, the user representations themselves may be used together with external data to recover private user information such as gender and age. In this paper we show that user vectors calculated by a common recommender system can be exploited in this way. We propose the privacy-adversarial framework to eliminate such leakage of private information, and study the trade-off between recommender performance and leakage both theoretically and empirically using a benchmark dataset. An advantage of the proposed method is that it also helps guarantee fairness of results, since all implicit knowledge of a set of attributes is scrubbed from the representations used by the model, and thus can't enter into the decision making. We discuss further applications of this method towards the generation of deeper and more insightful recommendations."

    "abstract": "Latent factor models for recommender systems represent users and items as low dimensional vectors. Privacy risks have been previously studied mostly in the context of recovery of personal information in the form of usage records from the training data. However, the user representations themselves may be used together with external data to recover private user information such as gender and age. In this paper we show that user vectors calculated by a common recommender system can be exploited in this way. We propose the privacy-adversarial framework to eliminate such leakage, and study the trade-off between recommender performance and leakage both theoretically and empirically using a benchmark dataset. We briefly discuss further applications of this method towards the generation of deeper and more insightful recommendations."

Central to the approach is a novel formulation of Open IE as a sequence tagging problem, addressing challenges such as encoding multiple extractions for a predicate. We also develop a bi-LSTM transducer, extending recent deep Semantic Role Labeling models to extract Open IE tuples and provide confidence scores for tuning their precision-recall tradeoff. Furthermore, we show that the recently released Question-Answer Meaning Representation dataset can be automatically converted into an Open IE corpus which significantly increases the amount of available training data. Our supervised model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art Open IE systems on benchmark datasets."

We demonstrate that a trained agent fails completely when facing small visual changes, and that fine-tuning\u2014the common transfer learning paradigm\u2014fails to adapt to these changes, to the extent that it is faster to re-train the model from scratch. We show that by separating the visual transfer task from the control policy we achieve substantially better sample efficiency and transfer behavior, allowing an agent trained on the source task to transfer well to the target tasks. The visual mapping from the target to the source domain is performed using unaligned GANs, resulting in a control policy that can be further improved using imitation learning from imperfect demonstrations. We demonstrate the approach on synthetic visual variants of the Breakout game, as well as on transfer between subsequent levels of Road Fighter, a Nintendo car-driving game.

We consider the case of RNNs with finite precision whose computation time is linear in the input length. Under these limitations, we show that different RNN variants have different computational power. In particular, we show that the LSTM and the Elman-RNN with ReLU activation are strictly stronger than the RNN with a squashing activation and the GRU. This is achieved because LSTMs and ReLU-RNNs can easily implement counting behavior. We show empirically that the LSTM does indeed learn to effectively use the counting mechanism."

It has been addressed in the literature either as a classification task to a set of pre-defined relations or by producing free text paraphrases explicating the relations. Most existing paraphrasing methods lack the ability to generalize, and have a hard time interpreting infrequent or new noun-compounds. We propose a neural model that generalizes better by representing paraphrases in a continuous space, generalizing for both unseen noun-compounds and rare paraphrases. Our model helps improving performance on both the noun-compound paraphrasing and classification tasks."

To aid this, we present a new train-development-test data split and neural models augmented with a copy-mechanism, outperforming the best reported baseline by 8.68 BLEU and fostering further progress on the task."

Linguistics tools, including morphological analyzers, part-of-speech taggers and parsers often have limited in performance on Morphologically Rich Languages (MRLs) such as Hebrew. In this paper, we adopted a schematic methodology for generating a cooccurrence based thesaurus in a MRL and extended the methodology to create distributional similarity thesaurus. We explored three alternative levels of morphological term representations, surface form, lemma, and multiple lemmas, all complemented by the clustering of morphological variants. First, we evaluated both the co-occurrence based method and the distributional similarity method using Hebrew WordNet as our gold standard. However, due to Hebrew WordNet's low coverage, we completed our analysis with a manual evaluation. The results showed that for Modern Hebrew corpus-based thesaurus construction, the most directly applied statistical collection, using linguistics tools at the lemma level, is not optimal."

We show that it is possible to generate localized adversarial noises that cover only 2% of the pixels in the image, none of them over the main object, and that are transferable across images and locations, and successfully fool a state-of-the-art Inception v3 model with very high success rates."

Following, we design a neural sequence-to-sequence framework which can effectively recover our graph linearizations, performing almost on-par with previous SDP state-of-the-art while requiring less parallel training annotations. Beyond SDP, our linearization technique opens the door to integration of graph-based semantic representations as features in neural models for downstream applications."

In this paper, we raise the research question of whether reference summaries of a single length can be used to reliably evaluate system summaries of multiple lengths. For that, we have analyzed a couple of datasets as a case study, using several variants of the ROUGE metric that are standard in summarization evaluation. Our findings indicate that the evaluation protocol in question is indeed competitive. This result paves the way to practically evaluating varying-length summaries with simple, possibly existing, summarization benchmarks."

To achieve this, we embrace the ambiguity of NL requirements and define a three-fold research agenda wherein we (i) formalize text-to-code translation as a structure prediction task,(ii) propose a formal semantic representation in terms of Live Sequence Charts (LSCs), and (iii) develop and comparatively evaluate novel sentence-based vs. discourse-based models for semantic parsing of requirements documents, and test their accuracy on various case studies. The empirical results of our first research cycle show that the discourse-based models consistently outperform the sentence-based models in constructing a system that reflects the requirements in the document. We conjecture that the formal representation of LSCs, the joint sentencediscourse modeling strategy, and the statistical learning component, are key ingredients for effectively tackling the NLPRO long-standing challenge."

A detailed qualitative analysis demonstrates that the crowd-generated question-answer pairs cover the vast majority of predicate-argument relationships in existing datasets (including PropBank, NomBank, QA-SRL, and AMR) along with many previously under-resourced ones, including implicit arguments and relations. The QAMR data and annotation code is made publicly available to enable future work on how best to model these complex phenomena."

In particular, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are flexible non-markovian models of sequential data, were shown to be effective for a variety of language processing tasks. Somewhat surprisingly, these seemingly purely sequential models are very capable at modeling syntactic phenomena, and using them result in very strong dependency parsers, for a variety of languages. In this talk, I will briefly describe recurrent-networks, and present empirical evidence for their capabilities of learning the subject-verb agreement relation in naturally occuring text, from relatively indirect supervision.

The core of our system is a joint morphological disambiguator and syntactic parser which accepts morphologically analyzed surface tokens as input and returns morphologically disambiguated dependency trees as output. Our parser requires a lattice as input, so we generate morphological analyses of surface tokens using a data-driven morphological analyzer that derives its lexicon from the UD training corpora, and we rely on UDPipe for sentence segmentation and surface-level tokenization. We report our official macro-average LAS is 56.56. Although our model is not as performant as many others, it does not make use of neural networks, therefore we do not rely on word embeddings or any other data source other than the corpora themselves. In addition, we show the utility of a lexicon-backed morphological analyzer for the MRL Modern Hebrew. We use our results on Modern Hebrew to argue that the UD community should define a UD-compatible standard for access to lexical resources, which we argue is crucial for MRLs and low resource languages in particular."

In addition, we design a novel model for factuality prediction by first extending a previous rule-based factuality prediction system and applying it over an abstraction of dependency trees, and then using the output of this system in a supervised classifier. We show that this model outperforms previous methods on all three datasets. We make both the unified factuality corpus and our new model publicly available."

RNNs performed this task well in common cases, but faltered in complex sentences (Linzen et al., 2016). We test whether these errors are due to inherent limitations of the architecture or to the relatively indirect supervision provided by most agreement dependencies in a corpus. We trained a single RNN to perform both the agreement task and an additional task, either CCG supertagging or language modeling. Multi-task training led to significantly lower error rates, in particular on complex sentences, suggesting that RNNs have the ability to evolve more sophisticated syntactic representations than shown before. We also show that easily available agreement training data can improve performance on other syntactic tasks, in particular when only a limited amount of training data is available for those tasks. The multi-task paradigm can also be leveraged to inject grammatical knowledge into language models."

    "abstract": "We describe DyNet, a toolkit for implementing neural network models based on dynamic declaration of network structure. In the static declaration strategy that is used in toolkits like Theano, CNTK, and TensorFlow, the user first defines a computation graph (a symbolic representation of the computation), and then examples are fed into an engine that executes this computation and computes its derivatives. In DyNet's dynamic declaration strategy, computation graph construction is mostly transparent, being implicitly constructed by executing procedural code that computes the network outputs, and the user is free to use different network structures for each input. Dynamic declaration thus facilitates the implementation of more complicated network architectures, and DyNet is specifically designed to allow users to implement their models in a way that is idiomatic in their preferred programming language (C++ or Python). One challenge with dynamic declaration is that because the symbolic computation graph is defined anew for every training example, its construction must have low overhead. To achieve this, DyNet has an optimized C++ backend and lightweight graph representation. Experiments show that DyNet's speeds are faster than or comparable with static declaration toolkits, and significantly faster than Chainer, another dynamic declaration toolkit. DyNet is released open-source under the Apache 2.0 license and available at this http URL."

However, existing toolkits-both static and dynamic-require that the developer organize the computations into the batches necessary for exploiting high-performance data-parallel algorithms and hardware. This batching task is generally difficult, but it becomes a major hurdle as architectures become complex. In this paper, we present an algorithm, and its implementation in the DyNet toolkit, for automatically batching operations. Developers simply write minibatch computations as aggregations of single instance computations, and the batching algorithm seamlessly executes them, on the fly, in computationally efficient batches. On a variety of tasks, we obtain throughput similar to manual batches, as well as comparable speedups over single-instance learning on architectures that are impractical to batch manually."

The parser bypasses the need for part-of-speech tagging, but uses word embeddings based on universal tag distributions. We achieved a macro-averaged LAS F1 of 65.11 in the official test run, which improved to 70.49 after bug fixes. We obtained the 2nd best result for sentence segmentation with a score of 89.03."

What distinguishes these representations (or embeddings) is that they are not trained with a specific application in mind, but rather to capture broadly useful features of the represented units. Another way to view their usage is through the lens of transfer learning: The embeddings are trained with one objective, but applied on others."

Our evaluation shows that generation with Relational-Realizational (Tsarfaty and Sima\u2019an, 2008) inspired grammar gets better language model scores than lexicalized grammarsa la Collins (2003), and that the latter gets better humanevaluation scores.

Our experiments on a Modern Hebrew case study show state of the art results, and we show that the morpheme-based MD consistently outperforms our word-based variant.

In this study, we refute this assertion by providing a principled derivation for NEG-based language modeling, founded on a novel analysis of a low-dimensional approximation of the matrix of pointwise mutual information between the contexts and the predicted words. The obtained language modeling is closely related to NCE language models but is based on a simplified objective function. We thus provide a unified formulation for two main language processing tasks, namely word embedding and language modeling, based on the NEG objective function. Experimental results on two popular language modeling benchmarks show comparable perplexity results, with a small advantage to NEG over NCE."

Two common methods include representations based on averaging word vectors, and representations based on the hidden states of recurrent neural networks such as LSTMs. The sentence vectors are used as features for subsequent machine learning tasks or for pre-training in the context of deep learning. However, not much is known about the properties that are encoded in these sentence representations and about the language information they capture. We propose a framework that facilitates better understanding of the encoded representations. We define prediction tasks around isolated aspects of sentence structure (namely sentence length, word content, and word order), and score representations by the ability to train a classifier to solve each prediction task when using the representation as input. We demonstrate the potential contribution of the approach by analyzing different sentence representation mechanisms. The analysis sheds light on the relative strengths of different sentence embedding methods with respect to these low level prediction tasks, and on the effect of the encoded vector's dimensionality on the resulting representations."

While certain practical methods do extract reduced argument spans, such as in Open-IE, these solutions are often ad-hoc and system-dependent, with no commonly accepted standards. In this paper we propose a generic argument reduction criterion, along with an annotation procedure, and show that it can be consistently and intuitively annotated using the recent QA-SRL paradigm."

In this work we present a neural model for efficiently learning a generic context embedding function from large corpora, using bidirectional LSTM. With a very simple application of our context representations, we manage to surpass or nearly reach state-of-the-art results on sentence completion, lexical substitution and word sense disambiguation tasks, while substantially outperforming the popular context representation of averaged word embeddings. We release our code and pretrained models, suggesting they could be useful in a wide variety of NLP tasks."

    "abstract": "While cross-lingual word embeddings have been studied extensively in recent years, the qualitative differences between the different algorithms remain vague. We observe that whether or not an algorithm uses a particular feature set (sentence IDs) accounts for a significant performance gap among these algorithms. This feature set is also used by traditional alignment algorithms, such as IBM Model-1, which demonstrate similar performance to state-of-the-art embedding algorithms on a variety of benchmarks. Overall, we observe that different algorithmic approaches for utilizing the sentence ID feature space result in similar performance. This paper draws both empirical and theoretical parallels between the embedding and alignment literature, and suggests that adding additional sources of information, which go beyond the traditional signal of bilingual sentence-aligned corpora, may substantially improve cross-lingual word embeddings, and that future baselines should at least take such features into account."

We show that it is consistently better to have POS supervision at the innermost rather than the outermost layer. We argue that this is because \u201clowlevel\u201d tasks are better kept at the lower layers, enabling the higher-level tasks to make use of the shared representation of the lower-level tasks. Finally, we also show how this architecture can be used for domain adaptation."

Such context-sensitive inferences have to consider both term meaning in context as well as the fine-grained relation holding between the terms. Hence, to develop suitable lexical inference methods, we need datasets that are annotated with fine-grained semantic relations in-context. Since existing datasets either provide outof-context annotations or refer to coarsegrained relations, we propose a methodology for adding context-sensitive annotations. We demonstrate our methodology by applying it to phrase pairs from PPDB 2.0, creating a novel dataset of finegrained lexical inferences in-context and showing its utility in developing contextsensitive methods."

In this work, we initiated manual annotation process for solving these issues. We identify the different elements in a coordination phrase and label each element with its function. We add phrase boundaries when these are missing, unify inconsistencies, and fix errors. The outcome is an extension of the PTB that includes consistent and detailed structures for coordinations. We make the coordination annotation publicly available, in hope that they will facilitate further research into coordination disambiguation."

The corpus was collected using Amazon Mechanical Turk following the \u2018Wizard-Of-Oz\u2019approach, where a \u2018wizard\u2019human translates the participants\u2019 natural language utterances in real time into a semantic language. Once dialogue collection was completed, utterances were annotated with intent labels by two independent annotators, achieving high inter-annotator agreement. Our initial experiments with an SVM classifier show that automatically inferring such labels from the utterances is far from trivial. We make our corpus publicly available to serve as an aid in the development of dialogue systems for negotiation agents, and suggest that analogous corpora can be created following our methodology and using our available source code. To the best of our knowledge this is the first publicly available negotiation dialogue corpus."

We also present a novel bi-LSTM model, which combines the POS tagging loss function with an auxiliary loss function that accounts for rare words. The model obtains state-of-the-art performance across 22 languages, and works especially well for morphologically complex languages. Our analysis suggests that bi-LSTMs are less sensitive to training data size and label corruptions (at small noise levels) than previously assumed."

A new generalization about these phenomena is uncovered, which is referred to as the Reciprocity-Symmetry Generalization (RSG). To analyze the RSG in full generality, we develop a new formal theory of lexical reciprocity building on Dowty\u2019s notion of proto-roles. Because of its foundational nature and plausibility for other languages besides English, the RSG is conjectured to be a language universal. Some general implications of this conjecture are discussed, especially regarding the organization of lexical meanings in different languages, and their relations with cognitive systems of concepts and categorization. Although the RSG is new with this paper, it appears to have been silently sensed since early transformational works in the 1960s, without any general analysis. By uncovering this generalization and accounting for it, the present work removes considerable confusion surrounding the pertinent semantic questions."

    "abstract": "Textual inference is an important component in many applications for understanding natural language. Classical approaches to textual inference rely on logical representations for meaning, which may be regarded as \"external\" to the natural language itself. However, practical applications usually adopt shallower lexical or lexical-syntactic representations, which correspond closely to language structure. In many cases, such approaches lack a principled meaning representation and inference framework. We describe an inference formalism that operates directly on language-based structures, particularly syntactic parse trees. New trees are generated by applying inference rules, which provide a unified representation for varying types of inferences. We use manual and automatic methods to generate these rules, which cover generic linguistic structures as well as specific lexical-based inferences. We also present a novel packed data-structure and a corresponding inference algorithm that allows efficient implementation of this formalism. We proved the correctness of the new algorithm and established its efficiency analytically and empirically. The utility of our approach was illustrated on two tasks: unsupervised relation extraction from a large corpus, and the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) benchmarks."

This way we can skip manual annotation for new event types, while requiring only minimal annotated training data for few example events at system setup. Our method is evaluated on the ACE-2005 dataset, achieving 5.7% F1 improvement over a state-of-the-art supervised system which uses the full training data."

Methods for learning entailment rules between predicates that take into account dependencies between different rules (e.g., entailment is a transitive relation) have been shown to improve rule quality, but suffer from scalability issues, that is, the number of predicates handled is often quite small. In this article, we present methods for learning transitive graphs that contain tens of thousands of nodes, where nodes represent predicates and edges correspond to entailment rules (termed entailment graphs). Our methods are able to scale to a large number of predicates by exploiting structural properties of entailment graphs such as the fact that they exhibit a \u201ctree-like\u201d property.

In this work we propose a simple model for lexical substitution, which is based on the popular skip-gram word embedding model. The novelty of our approach is in leveraging explicitly the context embeddings generated within the skip-gram model, which were so far considered only as an internal component of the learning process. Our model is efficient, very simple to implement, and at the same time achieves state-ofthe-art results on lexical substitution tasks in an unsupervised setting."

In this paper, we introduce multi-level alignments as a central, powerful representation for TE algorithms that encourages modular, reusable, multilingual algorithm development.

In contrast to prior reports, we observe mostly local or insignificant performance differences between the methods, with no global advantage to any single approach over the others."

Accordingly, many NLP applications would benefit from high coverage knowledgebases of paraphrases and entailment rules. To this end, learning such knowledgebases from the Web is especially appealing due to its huge size as well as its highly heterogeneous content, allowing for a more scalable rule extraction of various domains. However, the scalability of state-of-the-art entailment rule acquisition approaches from the Web is still limited. We present a fully unsupervised learning algorithm for Webbased extraction of entailment relations. We focus on increased scalability and generality with respect to prior work, with the potential of a large-scale Web-based knowledgebase. Our algorithm takes as its input a lexical\u2013syntactic template and searches the Web for syntactic templates that participate in an entailment relation with the input template. Experiments show promising results, achieving performance similar to a state-of-the-art unsupervised algorithm, operating over an offline corpus, but with the benefit of learning rules for different domains with no additional effort."

In this work we present a novel kernel which facilitates efficient parsing with feature representations corresponding to a much larger set of combinations. We integrate the kernel into a parse reranking system and demonstrate its effectiveness on four languages from the CoNLL-X shared task. 1"

The need to check the quality of specifications is even more acute in <i>property-based design</i>, where the specification is the only input, serving as a basis to the development of the system. <i>Inherent vacuity</i> adapts the theory of vacuity in model checking to the setting of property-based design. Essentially, a specification is inherently vacuous if it can be mutated into a simpler equivalent specification, which is known, in the case of specifications in linear temporal logic, to coincide with the fact the specification is satisfied vacuously in all systems."

In contrast to typical representations based on neighboring words, a recently proposed approach suggests to represent a context of a target word by a substitute vector, comprising the potential fillers for the target word slot in that context. In this work we first propose a variant of substitute vectors, which we find particularly suitable for measuring context similarity. Then, we propose a novel model for representing word meaning in context based on this context representation. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art results on lexical substitution tasks in an unsupervised setting."

The goal of the shared task is to allow to train and test different participating systems on comparable data sets, thus providing an objective measure of comparison between state-of-the-art parsing systems on data data sets from a range of different languages. This 2014 SPMRL shared task is a continuation and extension of the SPMRL shared task, which was co-located with the SPMRL meeting at EMNLP 2013 (Seddah et al., 2013). This paper provides a short overview of the 2014 SPMRL shared task goals, data sets, and evaluation setup. Since the SPMRL 2014 largely builds on the infrastructure established for the SPMRL 2013 shared task, we start by reviewing the previous shared task (\\xa7 2) and then proceed to the 2014 SPMRL evaluation settings (\\xa7 3), data sets (\\xa7 4), and a task summary (\\xa7 5). Due to organizational constraints, this overview is published prior to the submission of all system test runs, and a more detailed overview including the description of participating systems and the analysis of their results will follow as part of (Seddah et al., 2014), once the shared task is completed."

While Open IE is a highly scalable approach, allowing unsupervised relation extraction from open domains, it currently has some limitations. First, it lacks the expressiveness needed to properly represent and extract complex assertions that are abundant in text. Second, it does not consolidate the extracted propositions, which causes simple queries above Open IE assertions to return insufficient or redundant information. To address these limitations, we propose in this position paper a novel representation for ID\u2013Propositional Knowledge Graphs (PKG). PKGs extend the Open IE paradigm by representing semantic inter-proposition relations in a traversable graph. We outline an approach for constructing PKGs from single and multiple texts, and highlight a variety of high-level applications that may leverage PKGs as their underlying information discovery and representation framework."

The constraints are incorporated into the arc-eager transition system as a set of preconditions for each transition and preserve the linear time complexity of the parser."

Moreover, we demonstrate that analogy recovery is not restricted to neural word embeddings, and that a similar amount of relational similarities can be recovered from traditional distributional word representations."

Other benefits over dependency-trees are explicit marking of logical relations between propositions, explicit marking of multiword predicate such as light-verbs, and a consistent representation for syntacticallydifferent but semantically-similar structures. The representation is meant to serve as a useful input layer for semanticoriented applications, as well as to provide a better starting point for further levels of semantic analysis such as semantic-rolelabeling and semantic-parsing."

Based on this scheme, we implement a concrete model which utilizes probabilistic n-gram language models. Our evaluations suggest that this model is particularly wellsuited for measuring similarity for verbs, which are known to exhibit richer syntagmatic patterns, while maintaining comparable or better performance with respect to competitive baselines for nouns. Following this, we propose our scheme as a framework for future semantic similarity models leveraging the substantial body of work that exists in probabilistic language modeling."

The amount of association is either the count, or a function based on the count such as PMI, TF-IDF and so on. While choosing the association measure is important for obtaining good performance, it is not important to this explanation. Similarly, the documents can be generalized to any context a word appears in (eg same sentence, k preceding and following words, syntactic relations, and so on). Each row in C is associated with a word and each column is associated with a document. Each word vector reflects the contexts the word appears in, and each document vector reflects the words that appear in it. Based on the intuition that words appearing in similar documents (contexts) are similar, we can measure the similarity between words by measuring the similarity between their corresponding vectors (matrix rows). Similarly, we can measure the similarity between documents using the similarity between their corresponding document vectors (matrix columns). One common way of measuring similarity is the cosine similarity measure: simcos (x, y)=\u2329 x, y\u232a xy"

We find that another embedding method, NCE, is implicitly factorizing a similar matrix, where each cell is the (shifted) log conditional probability of a word given its context. We show that using a sparse Shifted Positive PMI word-context matrix to represent words improves results on two word similarity tasks and one of two analogy tasks. When dense low-dimensional vectors are preferred, exact factorization with SVD can achieve solutions that are at least as good as SGNS's solutions for word similarity tasks. On analogy questions SGNS remains superior to SVD. We conjecture that this stems from the weighted nature of SGNS's factorization."

Some recent attempts at this challenge are based on presenting structured information that was formulated according to pre-defined knowledge schemes, such as Freebase and Google\u2019s knowledge graph. We propose an alternative, as well as complementary, approach that attempts to consolidate and structure all textual statements in a document collection based on the inference relations between them.

This problem is aggravated by the fact that they are normally trained using oracles that are deterministic and incomplete in the sense that they assume a unique canonical path through the transition system and are only valid as long as the parser does not stray from this path. In this paper, we give a general characterization of oracles that are nondeterministic and complete, present a method for deriving such oracles for transition systems that satisfy a property we call arc decomposition, and instantiate this method for three well-known transition systems from the literature. We say that these oracles are dynamic, because they allow us to dynamically explore alternative and nonoptimal paths during training \u2014 in contrast to\\xa0\u2026"

The SD representation is useful for parser evaluation, for downstream applications, and, ultimately, for natural language understanding, however, the design of SD focuses on structurally-marked relations and under-represents morphosyntactic realization patterns observed in Morphologically Rich Languages (MRLs). We present a novel extension of SD, called Unified-SD (U-SD), which unifies the annotation of structurally-and morphologically-marked relations via an inheritance hierarchy. We create a new resource composed of U-SD-annotated constituency and dependency treebanks for the MRL Modern Hebrew, and present two systems that can automatically predict U-SD annotations, for gold segmented input as well as raw texts, with high baseline accuracy. 1 Introduction"

It thus cannot capture the notion that the target fragment is \u201calmost entailed\u201d by the given text. The recently suggested idea of partial textual entailment may remedy this problem. We investigate partial entailment under the faceted entailment model and the possibility of adapting existing textual entailment methods to this setting. Indeed, our results show that these methods are useful for recognizing partial entailment. We also provide a preliminary assessment of how partial entailment may be used for recognizing (complete) textual entailment."

Our evaluation shows that lexical expansion significantly improves performance in comparison to state-of-the-art baselines."

We demonstrate that, contrary to popular belief, most current implementations of beam parsers in fact run in O (n2), rather than linear time, because each statetransition is actually implemented as an O (n) operation. We present an improved implementation, based on Tree Structured Stack (TSS), in which a transition is performed in O (1), resulting in a real lineartime algorithm, which is verified empirically. We further improve parsing speed by sharing feature-extraction and dotproduct across beam items. Practically, our methods combined offer a speedup of\u223c 2x over strong baselines on Penn Treebank sentences, and are orders of magnitude faster on much longer sentences."

We present an improved oracle for the arc-eager transition system, which provides a set of optimal transitions for every valid parser configuration, including configurations from which the gold tree is not reachable. In such cases, the oracle provides transitions that will lead to the best reachable tree from the given configuration. The oracle is efficient to implement and provably correct. We use the oracle to train a deterministic left-to-right dependency parser that is less sensitive to error propagation, using an online training procedure that also explores parser configurations resulting from non-optimal sequences of transitions. This new parser outperforms greedy parsers trained using conventional oracles on a range of data sets, with an average improvement of over 1.2 LAS points and up to almost 3 LAS points on some data sets."

    "abstract": "Textual entailment is a binary relation between two natural language texts (the so-called text and hypothesis) that holds when readers of the text would agree that the hypothesis is most likely true (Peter is snoring\u2192 A man sleeps). The recognition of textual entailment requires an account of linguistic variability (ie, the possibility to realize a certain state of affairs in different ways, as in Peter buys the car\u2194 The car is purchased by Peter) as well as of the derivation of additional knowledge (as in Peter buys the car\u2192 Peter owns the car). In contrast to classical (logics-based) inference, textual entailment also covers cases of very probable, but still defeasible, entailment (A hurricane hit Peter\u2019s town\u2192 Peter\u2019s town was damaged). A substantial part of human common-sense reasoning involves such defeasible inferences. As a consequence, textual entailment is of considerable interest for many real-world language processing tasks where it can serve as a generic, application-independent framework for semantic inference. This chapter discusses the history of textual entailment, relevant linguistic phenomena, approaches to recognizing textual entailment, and its integration in various NLP tasks."

Since there is no available annotated data to learn the attachment preferences of the target domain words, we attack this problem using a model of selectional preferences based on domainspecific word classes. Our method uses Latent Dirichlet Allocations (LDA) to learn a domain-specific Selectional Preference model in the target domain using un-annotated data. The model provides features that model the affinities among pairs of words in the domain. To incorporate these new features in the parsing model, we adopt the co-training approach and retrain the parser with the selectional preferences features. We apply this method for adapting Easy First, a fast nondirectional parser trained on WSJ, to the biomedical domain (Genia Treebank). The Selectional Preference features reduce error by 4.5% over the co-training baseline."

We first identify that entailment graphs exhibit a \u201ctree-like\u201d property and are very similar to a novel type of graph termed forest-reducible graph. We utilize this property to develop an iterative efficient approximation algorithm for learning the graph edges, where each iteration takes linear time. We compare our approximation algorithm to a recently-proposed state-of-the-art exact algorithm and show that it is more efficient and scalable both theoretically and empirically, while its output quality is close to that given by the optimal solution of the exact algorithm."

In this paper, we claim that it is imperative to utilize information from various textual scopes: verb co-occurrence within a sentence, verb cooccurrence within a document, as well as overall corpus statistics. To this end, we propose a much richer novel set of linguistically motivated cues for detecting entailment between verbs and combine them as features in a supervised classification framework. We empirically demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms previous methods and that information from each textual scope contributes to the verb entailment learning task."

This raises a search challenge of finding the best possible proof. We explore this challenge through a comprehensive investigation of prominent search algorithms and propose two novel algorithmic components specifically designed for textual inference: a gradient-style evaluation function, and a locallookahead node expansion method. Evaluations, using the open-source system, BIUTEE, show the contribution of these ideas to search efficiency and proof quality."

We use the precision-biased parsing task to solve the related high-quality parse-selection task: finding a subset of high-quality (accurate) trees in a large collection of parsed text. We present a method for choosing over a third of the input trees while keeping unlabeled dependency parsing accuracy of 97% on these trees. We also present a method which is not based on an ensemble but rather on directly predicting the risk associated with individual parser decisions. In addition to its efficiency, this method demonstrates that a parsing system can provide reasonable estimates of confidence in its predictions without relying on ensembles or aggregate corpus counts."

These cluster features provide similar gains in accuracy to those achieved by distributional-similarity derived clusters. Using both types of cluster features together further improve tagging accuracies. We show that the method is effective for both the in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios for English, and for French, German and Italian. The effect is larger for out-of-domain text."

    "abstract": "Natural language is the primary means of communication between humans. Language is composed of words, which are combined to form sentences, which, in turn, are combined to form larger units such as paragraphs. While single words can convey myriad meanings, it is the combination of words into sentences that allows for efficient communication and the realization of complex ideas. When words are combined to form a sentence, their combination is governed by a set of rules, called the syntax, or the grammar, of the language. These syntactic rules pose constraints on the ways in which words can be combined (\u201ckid cake the ate a\u201d is clearly ungrammatical), and assign meanings to valid configurations of words (\u201cthe kid ate a cake\u201d and \u201cthe cake ate a kid\u201d are both well formed sentences and contain the exact same words, yet they convey two entirely different messages. The first is an everyday event, while the second is a creepy event from a bizarre horror movie). In other words, sentences must obey structural constraints posed by the syntax, and the structure of the sentence determines its meaning. In many cases, the sentence structure can be recovered even when the sentence words are unknown: consider \u201cthe plumpets ghoked a gloomp\u201d\u2013without knowing what plumpets, ghoked or gloomp are (these are all made-up words), we know that there is an action of \u201cghoking\u201d, there is something called \u201cplumpets\u201d(probably composed of several \u201cplumpet\u201d) which is the subject of the ghoking action (which happened in the past) and that there is something called a \u201cgloomp\u201d which is the object of the ghoking action.

This result indicates that lattice parsing with the Berkeley parser is an effective methodology for parsing over uncertain inputs."

We define a graph structure over predicates that represents entailment relations as directed edges, and use a global transitivity constraint on the graph to learn the optimal set of edges, by formulating the optimization problem as an Integer Linear Program. We motivate this graph with an application that provides a hierarchical summary for a set of propositions that focus on a target concept, and show that our global algorithm improves performance by more than 10% over baseline algorithms."

    "abstract": "We present a novel deterministic dependency parsing algorithm that attempts to create the easiest arcs in the dependency structure first in a non-directional manner. Traditional deterministic parsing algorithms are based on a shift-reduce framework: they traverse the sentence from left-to-right and, at each step, perform one of a possible set of actions, until a complete tree is built. A drawback of this approach is that it is extremely local: while decisions can be based on complex structures on the left, they can look only at a few words to the right. In contrast, our algorithm builds a dependency tree by iteratively selecting the best pair of neighbours to connect at each parsing step. This allows incorporation of features from already built structures both to the left and to the right of the attachment point. The parser learns both the attachment preferences and the order in which they should be performed. The result is a deterministic, best-first, O (nlogn) parser, which is significantly more accurate than best-first transition based parsers, and nears the performance of globally optimized parsing models."

The annotation procedure assumes that humans have knowledge about the linguistic phenomena relevant to inference, and a classification of such phenomena both into fine grained and macro categories is suggested. We experimented with the proposed methodology over a sample of pairs taken from the RTE-5 data set, and investigated critical issues arising when entailment, contradiction or unknown pairs are considered. The result is a new resource, which can be profitably used both to advance the comprehension of the linguistic phenomena relevant to entailment judgments and to make a first step towards the creation of large-scale specialized data sets."

Therefore, an experimental study was carried out to assess the relevance of anaphora and coreference for Textual Entailment (TE), a prominent inference framework. First, the annotation of anaphoric and coreferential links in the RTE-5 Search data set was performed according to a specifically designed annotation scheme. As a result, a new data set was created where all anaphora and coreference instances in the entailing sentences which are relevant to the entailment judgment are solved and annotated. A by-product of the annotation is a new \u201caugmented\u201d data set, where all the referring expressions which need to be resolved in the entailing sentences are replaced by explicit expressions. Starting from the final output of the annotation, the actual impact of discourse phenomena on inference engines was investigated, identifying the kind of operations that the systems need to apply to address discourse phenomena and trying to find direct mappings between these operation and annotation types."

Candidate replacements are paraphrases and entailed phrases, obtained using monolingual resources. These candidate replacements are transformed into \u201cdynamic biphrases\u201d, generated at decoding time based on the context of each source sentence. Standard SMT features are enhanced with a number of new features aimed at scoring translations produced by using different replacements. Active learning is used to discriminatively train the model parameters from human assessments of the quality of translations. The learning framework yields an SMT system which is able to deal with sentences containing OOV words but also guarantees that the performance is not degraded for input sentences without OOV words. Results of experiments on English-French translation show that this method outperforms previous work addressing OOV words in terms of acceptability."

The current work exhibits strong ties to some earlier lines of research, particularly automatic acquisition of paraphrases and lexical semantic relationships and unsupervised inference in applications such as question answering, information extraction and summarization. It has also opened the way to newer lines of research on more involved inference methods, on knowledge representations needed to support this natural language understanding challenge and on the use of learning methods in this context. RTE has fostered an active and growing community of researchers focused on the problem of applied entailment. This special issue of the JNLE provides an opportunity to showcase some of the most important work in this emerging area."

We propose a generic semantic inference framework that operates directly on syntactic trees. New trees are inferred by applying entailment rules, which provide a unified representation for varying types of inferences. Rules were generated by manual and automatic meth-ods, covering generic linguistic structures as well as specific lexical-based inferences. Initial empirical eval-uation in a Relation Extraction setting supports the va-lidity of our approach."

The key idea underlying the architecture is the application of the traditional notion of a \u201cparadigm\u201d to the syntactic domain. N-place predicates associated with paradigm cells are viewed as relational networks that are realized recursively by combining and ordering cells from other paradigms. The complete morphosyntactic representation of a sentence is then viewed as a nested integrated structure interleaving function and form by means of realization rules. This architecture, called Relational-Realizational, has a simple instantiation as a generative probabilistic model of which parameters can be statistically learned from treebank data. An application of this model to Hebrew allows for accurate description of word-order and argument marking patterns familiar from Semitic traditional grammars. The associated treebank grammar can be used for statistical parsing and is shown to improve state-of-the-art parsing results for Hebrew. The availability of a simple, formal, robust, implementable and statistically interpretable working model opens new horizons in computational linguistics\u2014at least in principle, we should now be able to quantify typological trends which have so far been stated informally or only tacitly reflected in corpus statistics."

A subtask was also proposed, aimed at detecting novel information. To continue the effort of testing RTE in NLP applications, a KBP Validation Pilot Task was set up, in which RTE systems had to validate the output of systems participating in the KBP Slot Filling Task. Eighteen teams participated in the Main Task (48 submitted runs) and 9 in the Novelty Detection Subtask (22 submitted runs). As for the Pilot, 10 runs were submitted by 3 participants. Finally, the exploratory effort started in RTE-5 to perform resource evaluation through ablation tests was not only reiterated in RTE-6, but also extended to tools."

The evaluation is performed both in an artificial setting, in which the data is assumed to be properly morphologically segmented and POS-tagged, and in a real-world setting, in which the parsing is performed on automatically segmented and POS-tagged text. We present an evaluation measure that takes into account the possibility of incompatible token segmentation between the gold standard and the parsed data. Results indicate that (a) MST-parser performs better on Hebrew data than Malt-Parser, and (b) both parsers do not make good use of morphological information when parsing Hebrew. 1 Introduction"

The preparation of the data set for this task has provided an opportunity to better understand some phenomena concerning textual entailment recognition in a natural setting. This paper focuses on some problematic issues related to resolving coreferences to entities, space, time and events at the corpus level, as emerged during the annotation of the data set for the textual entailment Search Pilot."

The method was motivated by attempts to utilize distributional similarity for identifying the concrete semantic relationship of lexical entailment. Our analysis revealed that a major reason for the rather loose semantic similarity obtained by distributional similarity methods is insufficient quality of the word feature vectors, caused by deficient feature weighting. This observation led to the definition of a bootstrapping scheme which yields improved feature weights, and hence higher quality feature vectors. The underlying idea of our approach is that features which are common to similar words are also most characteristic for their meanings, and thus should be promoted. This idea is realized via a bootstrapping step applied to an initial standard approximation of the similarity space. The\\xa0\u2026"

While standard models require as many as 100K distinct features, we derive models with as little as 1K features that perform as well or better on different domains. These robust reduced models indicate that the way rare lexical features contribute to classification in NLP is not fully understood. Contrastive error analysis (with and without lexical features) indicates that lexical features do contribute to resolving some semantic and complex syntactic ambiguities\u2013but we find this contribution does not generalize outside the training corpus. As a general strategy, we believe lexical features should not be directly derived from a training corpus but instead, carefully inferred and selected from other sources."

This goal is followed in common modeling of the morphological and syntactic levels of natural language, where most processing tasks are encapsulated within morphological analyzers and syntactic parsers. In this talk I suggest that computational modeling of the semantic level should also focus on encapsulating the various processing tasks within a unified module (engine). The input/output specification of such engine (API) can be based on the textual entailment paradigm, which will be described in brief and suggested as an attractive framework for applied semantic inference. The talk will illustrate an initial proposal for the engine\u2019s API, designed to be embedded within the prominent language processing applications. Finally, I will sketch the entailment formalism and efficient inference algorithm developed at Bar-Ilan University, which illustrates a principled transformational (rather than interpretational) approach towards developing a comprehensive semantic engine."

We designed a tagset specific to Hebrew while focusing on four aspects: the tagset should be consistent with common linguistic knowledge; there should be maximal agreement among taggers as to the tags assigned to maintain consistency; the tagset should be useful for machine taggers and learning algorithms; and the tagset should be effective for applications relying on the tags as input features. In this paper, we illustrate these issues by explaining our decision to introduce a tag for beinoni forms in Hebrew. We explain how this tag is defined, and how it helped us improve manual tagging accuracy to a high-level, while improving automatic tagging and helping in the task of syntactic chunking."

    "abstract": "Morphologically rich languages pose a challenge to the annotators of treebanks with respect to the status of orthographic (spacedelimited) words in the syntactic parse trees. In such languages an orthographic word may carry various, distinct, sorts of information and the question arises whether we should represent such words as a sequence of their constituent morphemes (ie, a Morpheme-Based annotation strategy) or whether we should preserve their special orthographic status within the trees (ie, a Word-Based annotation strategy). In this paper we empirically address this challenge in the context of the development of Language Resources for Modern Hebrew. We compare and contrast the Morpheme-Based and Word-Based annotation strategies of pronominal clitics in Modern Hebrew and we show that the Word-Based strategy is more adequate for the purpose of training statistical parsers as it provides a better PP-attachment disambiguation capacity and a better alignment with initial surface forms. Our findings in turn raise new questions concerning the interaction of morphological and syntactic processing of which investigation is facilitated by the parallel treebank we made available."

    "abstract": "Current parameters of accurate unlexicalized parsers based on Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFGs) form a twodimensional grid in which rewrite events are conditioned on both horizontal (headoutward) and vertical (parental) histories. In Semitic languages, where arguments may move around rather freely and phrasestructures are often shallow, there are additional morphological factors that govern the generation process. Here we propose that agreement features percolated up the parse-tree form a third dimension of parametrization that is orthogonal to the previous two. This dimension differs from mere \u201cstate-splits\u201d as it applies to a whole set of categories rather than to individual ones and encodes linguistically motivated co-occurrences between them. This paper presents extensive experiments with extensions of unlexicalized PCFGs for parsing Modern Hebrew in which tuning the parameters in three dimensions gradually leads to improved performance. Our best result introduces a new, stronger, lower bound on the performance of treebank grammars for parsing Modern Hebrew, and is on a par with current results for parsing Modern Standard Arabic obtained by a fully lexicalized parser trained on a much larger treebank."

Entailment is a directional relation between two expressions in which one of them implies the other, whereas paraphrase is a relation in which two expressions convey essentially the same meaning. Indeed, paraphrase can be defined as bi-directional entailment. While it may be debatable how such semantic definitions can be made well-founded, in practice we have already seen evidence that such knowledge is essential for many applications."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of acquiring lexical semantic relationships, applied to the lexical entailment relation. Our main contribution is a novel conceptual integration between the two distinct acquisition paradigms for lexical relations-the pattern-based and the distributional similarity approaches. The integrated method exploits mutual complementary information of the two approaches to obtain candidate relations and informative characterizing features. Then, a small size training set is used to construct a more accurate supervised classifier, showing significant increase in both recall and precision over the original approaches."

This paper proposes a definition for lexical reference which captures the common goals of lexical matching. Based on this definition we created and analyzed a test dataset that was utilized to directly evaluate, compare and improve lexical matching models. We suggest that such decomposition of the global semantic matching task is critical in order to fully understand and improve individual components."

The major findings suggest that distributional similarity provides a useful complementary estimate for the likelihood that two Wordnet synonyms are indeed substitutable, while proper modeling of contextual constraints is still a challenging task for future research."

We analyze the potential of our approach and evaluate an implemented prototype of it using an RE dataset. Our findings reveal a high potential for unsupervised paraphrase acquisition. We also identify the need for novel robust models for matching paraphrases in texts, which should address syntactic complexity and variability."

Current practice in building parsing models is not immediately applicable to languages that exhibit strong interaction between syntax and morphology, eg Modern Hebrew, Arabic and other Semitic languages. We suggest that incorporating morphological and morphosyntactic information into the parsing model is essential for parsing Semitic languages. Using a morphological analyzer, a part-of-speech tagger, and a PCFG-based general purpose parser, we segment and parse unseen MH sentences using a small annotated corpus. The Parseval scores obtained are not comparable to those of, eg, state-of-the-art models for English, due to remaining syntactic ambiguity and limited morphological treatment. We conjecture that adequate morphological and syntactic processing of MH should be done in a unified framework in which morphology and syntax can freely interact and share information in both directions."

The main purpose of this investigation is to establish a clear connection between causative constructions and aspectual meanings, two notions that are not so easily correlated. A secondary goal is to argue for the systematic aspectual contribution of Semitic derivational morphology. Our theory is inspired by Smith\u2019s causal chain and builds on a thematic account of Semitic derivational morphology. Combining a formal and empirical investigation we argue that the MH causative template Hiph\u2019il shifts the viewpoint of an event onto its initiation and development phases, making it more appropriate for imperfective use."

The RTE task is defined as recognizing, given two text fragments, whether the meaning of one text can be inferred (entailed) from the other. This application-independent task is suggested as capturing major inferences about the variability of semantic expression which are commonly needed across multiple applications. The Challenge has raised noticeable attention in the research community, attracting 17 submissions from diverse groups, suggesting the generic relevance of the task."

However, the scalability of state-of-the-art paraphrase acquisition approaches is still limited. We present a fully unsupervised learning algorithm for Web-based extraction of entailment relations, an extended model of paraphrases. We focus on increased scalability and generality with respect to prior work, eventually aiming at a full scale knowledge base. Our current implementation of the algorithm takes as its input a verb lexicon and for each verb searches the Web for related syntactic entailment templates. Experiments show promising results with respect to the ultimate goal, achieving much better scalability than prior Web-based methods."

    "abstract": "A most prominent phenomenon of natural languages is variability\u2013stating the same meaning in various ways. Robust language processing applications\u2013like Information Retrieval (IR), Question Answering (QA), Information Extraction (IE), text summarization and machine translation\u2013must recognize the different forms in which their inputs and requested outputs might be expressed. Today, inferences about language variability are often performed by practical systems at a\" shallow\" semantic level, due to the fact that robust semantic interpretation into logic-based meaning-level representations is not feasible. However, there is yet no generally applicable framework for modeling variability in an application independent manner. Consequently this problem is treated mostly independently within individual systems, and usually to a quite limited extent. In this paper we outline a proposal for a generic model for recognizing language variability at a shallow semantic level, its implementation as a practical engine to be leveraged within a variety of applications, and several learning tasks that it poses. Our approach is based on a notion of textual entailment between text expressions, capturing that the meaning of one expression can be inferred from the other. We propose an inference model that approximates entailment without any explicit interpretation into meaning representations, but rather operating directly over lexical-syntactic units. The model consists of a knowledge base of basic patterns along with compositional probabilistic inference rules, and can be implemented as a practical Prolog-style engine. We further propose learning approaches for\\xa0\u2026"

Finally, a novel feature weighting and selection function is presented, which yields superior feature vectors and better word similarity performance."

The value of an entry specifies the frequency of joint occurrence of the two words in the corpus; that is, the frequency in which they cooccur within some particular relations in the text. The degree of similarity between a pair of words is then computed by some similarity or distance measure that is applied to the corresponding pairs of vectors."

The system thus receives as input a pair of raw parallel texts and requires only a tokeniser (and possibly a lemmatiser) for each language. After tokenisation (and lemmatisation if necessary), a rough initial alignment is obtained for the texts using a version of Fung and McKeown\u2019s <i>DK-vec</i> algorithm (Fung und McKeown, 1997; Fung, this volume). The initial alignment is given as input to a version of the <i>word_ align</i> algorithm (Dagan, Church and Gale, 1993), an extension of Model 2 in the IBM statistical translation model. <i>Word_align</i>\\xa0\u2026"

    "abstract": "Recognizing shallow linguistic patterns, such as basic syntactic relationships between words, is a common task in applied natural language and text processing. The common practice for approaching this task is by tedious manual definition of possible pattern structures, often in the form of regular expressions or finite automata. This paper presents a novel memory-based learning method that recognizes shallow patterns in new text based on a bracketed training corpus. The training data are stored as-is, in efficient suffix-tree data structures. Generalization is performed on-line at recognition time by comparing subsequences of the new text to positive and negative evidence in the corpus. This way, no information in the training is lost, as can happen in other learning systems that construct a single generalized model at the time of training. The paper presents experimental results for recognizing noun phrase, subject-verb and verb-object patterns in English. Since the learning approach enables easy porting to new domains, we plan to apply it to syntactic patterns in other languages and to sub-language patterns for information extraction."

Three characteristic properties of this domain are (a) very high dimensionality,(b) both the learned concepts and the instances reside very sparsely in the feature space, and (c) a high variation in the number of active features in an instance. In this work we study three mistake-driven learning algorithms for a typical task of this nature--text categorization. We argue that these algorithms--which categorize documents by learning a linear separator in the feature space--have a few properties that make them ideal for this domain. We then show that a quantum leap in performance is achieved when we further modify the algorithms to better address some of the specific characteristics of the domain. In particular, we demonstrate (1) how variation in document length can be tolerated by either normalizing feature weights or by using negative weights,(2) the positive effect of applying a threshold range in training,(3) alternatives in considering feature frequency, and (4) the benefits of discarding features while training. Overall, we present an algorithm, a variation of Littlestone's Winnow, which performs significantly better than any other algorithm tested on this task using a similar feature set."

Traditional data handling methods are not adequate to cope with this information flood. Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) is a new paradigm that focuses on computerized exploration of large amounts of data and on discovery of relevant and interesting patterns within them. While most work on KDD is concerned with structured databases, it is clear that this paradigm is required for handling the huge amount of information that is available only in unstructured textual form. To apply traditional KDD on texts it is necessary to impose some structure on the data that would be rich enough to allow for interesting KDD operations. On the other hand, we have to consider the severe limitations of current text processing technology and define rather simple structures that can be extracted from texts fairly automatically and in a reasonable cost. We propose using a text categorization paradigm to annotate text articles with meaningful concepts that are organized in hierarchical structure. We suggest that this relatively simple annotation is rich enough to provide the basis for a KDD framework, enabling data summarization, exploration of interesting patterns, and trend analysis. This research combines the KDD and text categorization paradigms and suggests advances to the state of the art in both areas."

For example, a speech recognizer may need to determine which of the two word combinations``eat a peach''and``eat a beach''is more likely. Statistical NLP methods determine the likelihood of a word combination according to its frequency in a training corpus. However, the nature of language is such that many word combinations are infrequent and do not occur in a given corpus. In this work we propose a method for estimating the probability of such previously unseen word combinations using available information on``most similar''words. We describe a probabilistic word association model based on distributional word similarity, and apply it to improving probability estimates for unseen word bigrams in a variant of Katz's back-off model. The similarity-based method yields a 20% perplexity improvement in the prediction of unseen bigrams and statistically significant reductions in speech-recognition error."

Technical terms such as\" dialog box\" are difficult for translators because they are generally not as familiar with the subject domain as either the author of the source, text or the reader of the target text. Parallel texts could be used to help translators overcome their lack of domain expertise by providing them with the ability to search previously translated documents for examples of potentially difficult terminology and see how they were translated in the past.\" Existing translations contain more solutions to more translation problems than any other existing resource.\"(Isabelle, 1992)"

    "abstract": "In recent years there is much interest in word cooccurrence relations, such as n-grams, verbobject combinations, or cooccurrence within a limited context. This paper discusses how to estimate the probability of cooccurrences that do not occur in the training data. We present a method that makes local analogies between each specific unobserved cooccurrence and other cooccurrences that contain similar words, as determined by an appropriate word similarity metric. Our evaluation suggests that this method performs better than existing smoothing methods, and may provide an alternative to class based models."

    "abstract": "We have developed a new program called word_align for aligning parallel text, text such as the Canadian Hansards that are available in two or more languages. The program takes the output of char_align (Church, 1993), a robust alternative to sentence-based alignment programs, and applies word-level constraints using a version of Brown el al.'s Model 2 (Brown et al., 1993), modified and extended to deal with robustness issues. Word_align was tested on a subset of Canadian Hansards supplied by Simard (Simard et al., 1992). The combination of word_align plus char_align reduces the variance (average square error) by a factor of 5 over char_align alone. More importantly, because word_align and char_align were designed to work robustly on texts that are smaller and more noisy than the Hansards, it has been possible to successfully deploy the programs at AT&T Language Line Services, a commercial translation service, to help them with difficult terminology."

The model reduces the redundancy in the representation of semantic constraints and thus reduces the overall size of the semantic database as well as facilitating its acquisition. Our model implies that the same constraints may be used for translation in both directions. Using this property we suggest a scheme for the automatic acquisition of the semantic database using corpora from both languages."

    "abstract": "Identifying different types of similarities between words has been an important goal in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This chapter describes the basic statistical approach for computing the degree of similarity between words. In this approach a word is represented by a word co-occurrence vector in which each entry corresponds to another word in the lexicon. The value of an entry specifies the frequency of joint occurrence of the two words in the corpus, that is, the frequency in which they co-occur within some particular relationships in the text. The degree of similarity between a pair of words is then computed by some similarity or distance measure that is applied to the corresponding pairs of vectors. This chapter describes in detail different types of lexical relationships that can be used for constructing word cooccurrence vectors. It then defines a schematic form for vector-based similarity measures and describes concrete measures that correspond to the general form. We also give examples for word similarities identified by corpus-based measures, along with \u201cexplanations\u201d of the major data elements that entailed the observed similarity. This chapter describes in detail the basic vector-based approach for computing word similarity. Similarities may be computed between different lexical units, such as word strings, word lemmas, and multi-word terms or phrases. We shall use the term \u201cword\u201d to denote a lexical unit but the discussion applies to other units as well."

The main topic of the project is identifying semantic inferences between text units, a major language processing task, needed in practically all text understanding applications. While such inferences are broadly needed, there are currently no generic semantic engines or platforms for broad textual inference. The primary scientific motivation for the EXCITEMENT project is to change this ineffective state of affairs and to offer an encompassing open source platform for textual inference. On the industrial side, EXCITEMENT is focused on the text analytics market and follows the increasing demand for automatically analyzing customer interactions, which today cross multiple channels including speech, email, chat and social media."

In Section 2 we give the three sets of structural elements Stbase, Stmed, and Sthigh, and in Section 3 we give the three sets of sequential contexts Cobase, Comed, and Cohigh, which are used in our models.

Our parsers are embedded in PlayGo, a development environment for specifying (playing-in) requirements as LSCs and executing (playing-out) the resulting behavior.

The results suggest that:(1) The paraphrase expansion leads to better performance than the bag of words baseline.(2) The gain in performance often comes from a few most effective pivot languages.(3) The differences between machine translation engines are not reflected in empirical evaluation. By using the most effective pivot languages we can save the expenses to generate additional paraphrases, and as a result, to save the resources to train a classification model."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the results of the First WMT Shared Task on Sign Language Translation (WMT-SLT22) 1. This shared task is concerned with automatic translation between signed and spoken 2 languages. The task is novel in the sense that it requires processing visual information (such as video frames or human pose estimation) beyond the wellknown paradigm of text-to-text machine translation (MT). The task featured two tracks, translating from Swiss German Sign Language (DSGS) to German and vice versa. Seven teams participated in this first edition of the task, all submitting to the DSGS-to-German track. Besides a system ranking and system papers describing state-of-the-art techniques, this shared task makes the following scientific contributions: novel corpora, reproducible baseline systems and new protocols and software for human evaluation. Finally, the task also resulted in the first publicly available set of system outputs and human evaluation scores for sign language translation."

    "abstract": "One of the components of a dialog system is the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) component. This component accepts natural language text, and returns the meaning of that text, in some formal application-specific meaning representation. One of the difficulties in building NLU components is the variability in natural language-the many different ways by which a human can express the same meaning. We propose to tackle this difficulty by using a generic Textual Entailment (TE) system-a system that can calculate, for each pair of texts, whether the meaning of one of them can be inferred from the other. A single TE system can be used for various NLU components in various domains."

Translating them to Hebrew using Google\u2019s statistical MT system, yields: \u043e \u0434 \u0432 \u0434 \u0434 (I drive (masculine) a car); \u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0436 \u0430 \u0434 (I don\u2019t know (feminine) how to drive); \u0439 \u043c \u0434 \u043e \u0434 \u0432 \u043e (I wash (masculine) the car); and \u0438\u043a\u043c \u043e \u043e\u0438 \u043d \u0434 (I wash (feminine) the floor). While amusing and not quite politically correct, these are all arguably very good translations: without explicit gender marking, the translator can not know if the speaker is masculine or feminine, and he (she?) resorts to deciding based on her (his?) cultural knowledge."

Previous work on Morphological Disambiguation (MD) of MRLs has had variable success, with Semitic languages having sub-par results for downstream applications. Here we propose novel MD transition-based systems, both word-based and morphemebased, and tackle the challenge introduced by the variable length of hypothesized morpheme sequences. Our experiments show that transition-based morphemebased MD consistently outperforms the word-based variant, while providing new state of the art results on Hebrew MD."

Most previous approaches detect individual paraphrase instances within a pair (or set) of comparable corpora, each of them containing roughly the same information, and rely on the substantial level of correspondence of such corpora. We present a novel method that successfully detects isolated paraphrase instances within a single corpus without relying on any a-priori structure and information."

Prior resource-based approaches typically select the subset of each resource\u2019s relations which are relevant for a particular given task. The selection process is done manually, limiting these approaches to smaller resources such as WordNet, which lacks coverage of propernames and recent terminology. This paper presents a supervised framework for automatically selecting an optimized subset of resource relations for a given target inference task. Our approach enables the use of large-scale knowledge resources, thus providing a rich source of high-precision inferences over proper-names."

Nevertheless, it is approached mostly by heuristic methods which do not address major aspects of the lexical entailment scenario. We present, for the first time, a principled probabilistic approach for this task. Our model covers prominent aspects such as integrating various resources with different reliability, taking into account the length of the entailed sentence, the number of its covered terms and the existence of multiple evidence for the entailment of a term. Evaluations validate the impact of our model components and show that its performance is in line with the best published entailment systems."
